Even though they delivered all-time classics, they never earned that distinction. Without further ado, below are 10 wrestlers you won't believe never got a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer.</p><h2 id=edge><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Edge</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Edge-3.jpg><p>Edge has had an illustrious career, which certainly wasn't what it should have been due to injuries, but it has still been legendary. Edge is an incredibly talented wrestler, who at 48 years of age continues to deliver epic matches such as the Hell In A Cell Match against Seth Rollins or his match against Roman Reigns at Money In The Bank 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Surprisingly, however, <a href=#>the Rated R Superstar has never earned a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer</a>, and boy has he had some excellent matches that could be worthy of a perfect rating.</p><h2 id=kevin-owens><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kevin Owens</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Kevin-Owens.jpg><p>Kevin Owens is a phenomenal wrestler who has excellent technique, knows how to tell a story perfectly and isn't afraid to put his body on the line when necessary. He has delivered several sensational matches in both ROH and WWE, but he has yet to get a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kevin Owens' Highest Rated WWE Matches, According To Dave Meltzer</a></span></p><p>It's hard to believe that none of his epic encounters with Sami Zayn have convinced Meltzer, <a href=#>not even the "Fight Without Honor" match, which is arguably the best match of KO's career</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=curt-hennig><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Curt Hennig</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mr-Perfect.jpg><p>In the 80s there were few who could compare to <a href=#>Mr. Perfect</a> in terms of in-ring skills, and then in the 90s he kept putting on wrestling clinics over and over again, but never got more than four ¼ stars.</p><p>This is one of the downsides of Dave Meltzer's rating system, as his opinion can be very subjective at times. There are at least two Mr. Perfect matches that are worthy of five stars, both against Bret Hart, one at SummerSlam 1991 and one at King Of The Ring 1993.</p><h2 id=jeff-hardy><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jeff Hardy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jeff-Hardy-On-Top-Of-A-Ladder.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, you read that right, Jeff Hardy has never had a five-star match, not his <a href=#>epic tag team matches like the one at WrestleMania 17</a>, nor his mind-blowing singles matches like against CM Punk at SummerSlam 2009.</p><p>It's a little bit absurd that someone like Jeff Hardy, who has spent nearly 30 years taking horrific bumps, <a href=#>performing spectacular stunts</a> and putting on memorable shows, has never gotten a five-star rating.</p><h2 id=randy-savage><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Randy Savage</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Randy-Savage-As-WWE-Champion-Cropped.png><p>Randy Savage was one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, extremely charismatic, a fantastic worker and awesome talker, he was the complete package. Nonetheless, <a href=#>for Dave Meltzer, Savage's work was not good enough to give him a five-star rating</a>, not even in his perfect match against Ricky Steamboat at WrestleMania III, which got a four and a half star rating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, this means nothing in Macho Man’s legacy, as he will be forever remembered as a legend of sports entertainment.</p><h2 id=rob-van-dam><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rob Van Dam</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rob-Van-Dam-Cropped.jpg><p>If Rob Van Dam had had a little more control over his life outside the ring, perhaps the story would have been different. He could have become one of the biggest superstars of the 21st century, because he had so much charisma and incredible in-ring skills, with a unique arsenal of moves.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Most Fans Forget About Rob Van Dam's WWE Career</a></span></p><p>RVD has delivered countless epic matches, whether in WWE, ECW or TNA, but he has never earned a rating higher than four and a half stars.

HHH has been one of the most important wrestlers in WWE history, and is an icon of sports entertainment in general.</p><p>Throughout his career, Triple H starred in some all-time classics, against Cactus Jack, against The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Daniel Bryan, Chris Jericho, The Rock and against 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, but incredibly none of those got five stars.</p><h2 id=randy-orton><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Randy Orton</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Randy-Orton-br.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You won't believe that Randy Orton hasn't gotten a five-star rating either. Despite his long and extraordinary career and all his fantastic matches, he has not convinced Dave Meltzer.</p><p>The highest rating the Viper has ever gotten is four and a half stars. He has some matches with that rating, such as the No Holds Barred match against Mick Foley at Backlash 2004 and the Fatal Four Way Match against John Cena, Shawn Michaels and Edge at Backlash 2007.</p><h2 id=brock-lesnar><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Brock Lesnar</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Brock-Lesnar-2021.jpg><p>The Beast Incarnate has blown the minds of fans time and time again because of the things he can do in a ring, when he is wrestling, you never know what to expect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Brock Lesnar has put on countless insane, brutal, simply unforgettable shows</a>, yet he has never earned a five-star rating.

Frankly it doesn't make any sense that Kurt Angle doesn't have a five-star match, among so many masterpieces he delivered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMueqaxlnprDpr6MoKatZWViwLWt0WapmqyZo7RusMCvnGallaHBu7HRZqynmpWhtqbCwJujnmWnrLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
