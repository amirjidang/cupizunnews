That was particularly on display during awkward situations, like <a href=#>when Oprah asked her questions about her private life</a>, but the artist had a clever reply.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at yet another awkward moment. This one in particular featured a fan seeking an autograph and at a Destiny's Child meet and greet. The only problem was he was just looking for a signature from Beyoncé, and nobody else. Credit to Beyoncé, who had the perfect reaction. Things could've got even more awkward, but Bey ensured they did not.</p><p>Let's take a look back at how it all went down and how the fans reacted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:16</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/how-much-does-beyonce-earn-for-each-concert-after-taxes-and-expenses_-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Much Does Beyonce Earn For Each Concert After Taxes And Expenses?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Beyonce's concerts are not only awe-inspiring but also contribute to the singer's incredible net worth.</span><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-still-handed-over-the-book-to-her-other-destiny-39-s-child-members-after-a-fan-requested-only-her-autograph>Beyoncé Still Handed Over The Book To Her Other Destiny's Child Members After A Fan Requested Only Her Autograph</h2><p>Approaching a celebrity on the street can be risky, especially when seeking an autograph. However, at meet and greets, the vibe is generally positive. A fan tried to change that completely, going out of his way to get Beyoncé's signature, while snubbing the other members of Destiny's Child. He makes his intentions clear with Beyoncé, but the artist wasn't having it.</p><p>The fan says, "Just yours," while Beyoncé responds, "Alright." After she's done signing, Beyoncé proceeds to pass the book over to the Destiny's Child members regardless. You can even see the fan trying to get the book back, but Bey wasn't having it.</p><p>The clip also shows Michelle Williams sensing something was up during the moment, knowing Beyoncé had just shaded a fan for rude behavior.</p><p>The moment was caught, and it caused quite a stir.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:08</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-real-reason-why-fans-rarely-see-jay-z-and-beyonc-s-son-sir-carter.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Fans Rarely See Jay-Z and Beyoncé's Son Sir Carter</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jay-Z and Beyoncé's son, Sir Carter, has rarely been seen, but fans wonder if a traumatic experience is the reason why...</span><p>Credit to Bey, who didn't lose her cool or temper.

For the most part, the most liked comments were praising Beyonce's conduct, and that way she reacted on the spot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar49233918.jpg><p>The most liked comments wrote:</p><p>"Michelle caught that shade."Another fan wrote, "It's a shame how fans had no love in that group for anyone but Beyonce.

And I'm blessed to have even had that opportunity because there's some people that'll never get that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/destiny-s-child-2.jpg><p>She continues, “Everybody's just going on to do amazing things,” she says. “To also see everybody as moms and wives, we've grown up. We're adults out here, it's full-blown adulting going on.”</p><p>As for Beyoncé and her thoughts on Destiny's Child, the artist admitted in the past that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was "underestimated" in the group</a>.</p><p>"I'd say I discovered my power after the first Destiny's Child album. The label didn't really believe we were pop stars," Beyonce shares. "They underestimated us, and because of that, they allowed us to write our own songs and write our own video treatments. It ended up being the best thing, because that's when I became an artist and took control."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continues, "So we created it on our own, and once it was successful, I realized that we had the power to create whatever vision we wanted for ourselves," she adds. "We didn't have to go through other writers or have the label create our launch plans -- we had the power to create those things ourselves."</p><p>Beyoncé's respect holds true for the group until this very day, and it is great to see how much faith she always had, despite the lack of belief from others regarding the group's vision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnrGfo7Cmec%2BrmKKrlZl6p7vRZqqhmZSeu6h5wKdkmq2kpLSzrc%2BhZKydlaCys3nWoaZmp56hxm7DwKernpxdnbKzecCuq6ifopa9qXnWoaClnV2pv7q1zaBkraddqLu2roytn55ln6m1pr6MnZysrJmjxrR5wqGgpZxdorKursSrqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
