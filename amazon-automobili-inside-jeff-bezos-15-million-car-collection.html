While the Founder of Amazon is known to have a relatively low-key lifestyle, he certainly requires speed taking in <a href=#>his giant car collection</a>. With a net worth of an astonishing $195 billion, Bezos spent a comparatively small fortune to add some supercars to his garage. Not only does his <a href=#>collection feature some of the fastest cars</a> in the world, but they are also rare in number, which makes them all the more valuable.</p><p>From Italian brands and manufacturers like Lamborghini and Ferrari to Lebanese production brands such as W Motors and Swedish company Koenigsegg, Jeff Bezos has acquired a diverse portfolio of cars, each unique from the other. Let’s take a look inside the billionaire’s garage and check out the cars worth $15 million.</p><h2 id=lamborghini-veneno-5-000-000>Lamborghini Veneno ($5,000,000)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Knocking down the racing barrier, Lamborghini celebrated fifty years of its moniker in style when it introduced the Veneno in 2013.
