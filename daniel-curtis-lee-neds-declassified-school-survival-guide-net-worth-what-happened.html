The show was so popular among its fan base that they are interested to know what the biggest stars have been up to since it ended, which is why there has been the release of Ned's Declassified Podcast Survival Guide (via JustJared). Lee joined his <a href=#>former costars Devon Werkheiser</a> and Linsdsey Shaw to discuss their time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Biggest Reveals 'Zoey 101' Star Alexa Nikolas Is Making On Instagram</a></span></p><p>It is interesting to note that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee's character, Cookie, was not in the pilot episode</a>. "They shot a pilot before my character was even introduced. Now, I auditioned for that pilot, but... I made it very far in my auditions," Lee said, according to JustJared. "We filmed the pilot for Ned's that had a different third best friend, [played by] Stephen Markarian," Werkheiser revealed. The character was Boogie.</p><p>This was not the only casting change after the pilot episode. JoJo was reportedly initially cast as Lisa Zemo (a role that later went to Rachel Sibner). "That was before she was JoJo... One of the best voices we have ever, she's amazing," Devon Werkheiser explained. "She was the original Lisa Zemo."</p><p>"She killed it. So good," Linsdsey Shaw added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daniel-curtis-lee-1.jpg><p>But will the show be getting a reboot anytime soon? There has been some speculation about this after it was reported that <a href=#>Zoey 101 will be rebooted</a> (via ScreenRant) and renamed Zoey 102. Despite fan interest in it, Devon Werkheiser addressed why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nickelodeon would not pick up Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a>.</p><p>"Let's be real. They favor Dan Schneider content. They always have. He created like half their universe. I get it. I don't know because we pitched such a great pitch," Werkheiser said, according to ScreenRant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I pitched the reboot with Scott Fellows, the creator, and Michelle Fellows, his wife. A great pitch for us as adults. T​​​hey don't want it, or they don't want it right now. It was so passive. It was like,​​​​​​ 'Great pitch.​​​​​​​ Not right now,' but also we were like, 'We want to sell it. We'll pay you. Just let us go sell it.' They're like, 'We're gonna hold​​​​​​​ it and do nothing with it, and thank​​​​​​​ you, great pitch.' It just felt so passive." According to these comments, it does not sound like the three main stars will return to the screen as their original characters, but who knows what the future holds?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaZmrlur9Srq6KrXaGypnnNnpusZZSasK2t0qygn6GVmXq0r8eopqVlo6q%2Ft7XVmqNmn6WesaZ5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpedahmK1lmJa9sbHNnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
