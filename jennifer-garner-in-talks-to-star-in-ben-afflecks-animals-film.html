This happens. It is somebody I love and respect, but to whom I should not be married any longer. And then we said, ‘You know what? We tried. We tried because we had kids.’”</p><p>Throughout their separation and subsequent divorce, both Affleck and Garner have been vocal about <a href=#>coparenting their three kids</a>, Violet, 18, Seraphina 15, and Samuel, 11.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source even told Us Weekly in 2020 that coparenting was “<a href=#>always a work in progress</a>” for the exes.</p><p>“Things come up between them, but they are committed to doing the best they can for the kids. They stay on top of things and have a lot of meetings and check-ins,” the insider added at the time. “They want to be the best parents they can for the kids. If they have differences, they keep it to themselves and don’t let it have an impact. They always put on happy faces for the kids and put their well-being first.”</p><p>Garner has been in a relationship with <strong>John Miller</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>since 2018</a>.
