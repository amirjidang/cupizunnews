When it comes to promoting films, nobody does it quite like Tom Cruise. The actor has made a living promoting his films worldwide. Unlike other major Hollywood stars, Cruise always made it a priority to properly promote his films internationally, instead of just in the US market.</p><p>However, fans did notice something during his interaction with the fans. He signs autographs but never gets too close. Even when a fan asks for a selfie, Cruise refuses and asks the fan to turn the camera around from a distance.</p><p>Fans can take a look at the moment below.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Margot Robbie, Leonardo DiCaprio And Brad Pitt All Had The Same Answer When Asked If They Ever Secretly Watching Their Own Film In Theaters Like Tom Cruise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans had a lot to say about the ordeal.

Such a sad moments when Tom Cruise had taken risk every day just to made us a good movie.....
