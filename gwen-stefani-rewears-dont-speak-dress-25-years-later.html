Gwen Stefani sent TikTok into tizzy on the 25th anniversary of “Don’t Speak,” her iconic single from No Doubt, which was released in 1995.
As for what caused all the ruckus? Well, she broke out a reimagined version of the original polka dress she famously wore in the music video.
“Here I am! Don’t speak. Look at that,” the 51-year-old artist said to the camera, showing off her vintage outfit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But, upon further inspection (obviously Stylish did some digging), it appears Stefani made some modern day adjustments to her look.</p><p class=p1>She gave the navy polka dot dress a bit of a remake. The sleeves were switched up to be a bit puffy around the shoulders, the was was cinched for a fit and flare cut and, most notably, the hem was cut to her mid thigh.</p><p class=p1>Stefani also added some fishnet tight and — wait for it — cowboy boots! The white leather stiletto shoes were a sentimental nod to her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“[They’re] a little of Blake,” she says in the video, showing off her booties.
