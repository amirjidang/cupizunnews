Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what the personal trainer told</a>Men's Health:</p><p>"I just want her to be happy. If something makes her happy, I'll do it. I'm not going to argue.

Yes, the princess of pop is all about physical exercise, and here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Sam revealed</a> about their exercising regime:</p><p>"A lot of people don’t get that she’s a crazy, crazy athlete. We play tennis together. We play ping-pong together. She’s really good at ping-pong. It’s a real competition. And I’m competitive, but I try to take it easy. Not because she’s a woman. Not because she’s weak, because she’s not. But I grew up with three sisters, so I learned that taking competition too seriously can lead to hurt feelings. Family take it easy on each other. There's a lot of yoga that she likes to do. She's flexible, she has endurance, she does handstands on my legs. I'm not good at it, but I do it because she wants to do it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sam-openly-admitted-what-he-thinks-about-britney-39-s-conservatorship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sam Openly Admitted What He Thinks About Britney's Conservatorship</span></h2><p>Recently, the popstar publicly opened up about the struggles she has been going through with the conservatorship arrangement imposed in 2008.

My friend called me and said, ‘I need you to be on it. Trust me, you want to show up.’ I didn’t know who was shooting. It was a secret project. So I showed up because of my friend.
