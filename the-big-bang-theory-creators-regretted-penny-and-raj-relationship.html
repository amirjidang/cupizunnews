We're going to showcase some regrettable storylines, including a certain moment that featured Raj and Penny getting together. After the season 4 finale was shot, creator Steve Molaro instantly regretted it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chuck-lorre-s-big-bang-theory-regrets-started-with-the-pilot>Chuck Lorre's Big Bang Theory Regrets Started With The Pilot</h2><p>Big Bang Theory enjoyed huge success, however, behind the scenes, things weren't always the smoothest and that started with the pilot. A certain scene featured Sheldon and Leonard at the sperm bank. Looking back, the context proved that both stars were very much out of character during the scene. This was completely normal, given that Sheldon and Leonard really didn't have much of an identity yet.</p><p>Nonetheless, when it came to syndication, Lorre had the pilot scene removed from the episode, due to the simple fact that it didn't match Sheldon and Leonard's attributes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How The Big Bang Theory's Chuck Lorre Broke The Awkward Tension Between Kaley Cuoco And Johnny Galecki After Their Breakup</a></span></p><p>Looking back, even <a href=#>Jim Parsons himself understood why the scene was ultimately cut out.</a></p><p>He said, "At the time, the sperm bank scene didn’t bother me. Looking back, it was out of place, but there was no way for the producers to know… Nobody knew who Sheldon was yet, so the live audience accepted it for what it was."</p><p>"But it is confusing information now, and I get why Chuck took it out of syndication because the episode is much stronger and more special without it."</p><p>As for another scene, it was too late to back track from it...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steve-molaro-hated-the-penny-raj-storyline-and-tried-to-get-out-of-it>Steve Molaro Hated The Penny/Raj Storyline, And Tried To Get Out Of it</h2><p>Season 4 ended with a 'big bang', literally... However, for creator Steve Molaro, it was a little too much and most importantly, the creator didn't feel as though the moment matched the characters and who they had become on the series.</p><p>The finale saw Penny and Raj walk out of bed together. Instantly, <a href=#>Molaro regretted the situation</a>. Once the season came to an end, he realized the show had made a major mistake. It was Chuck Lorre who came up with the idea, in order to shake things up.</p><p>Molaro said about the moment, "I spent the entire hiatus being upset about it… I went upstairs to [Lorre’s] office right when we got back to work [on Season 5] and said something like, ‘This is really bothering me. I think I have a way that we can… get out of it and preserve the characters as they are."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He didn’t love it, but he knew it was important to me to the point that he conceded.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Jerry O'Connell Really Felt About Appearing On The Big Bang Theory</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, it was Lorre himself who came up with the resolution, showing nothing had happened between to two, due to Raj's 'over-excitement'.</p><h2 id=kunal-nayyar-wasn-t-thrilled-about-certain-raj-storylines-either>Kunal Nayyar Wasn't Thrilled About Certain Raj Storylines Either</h2><p>Kunal Nayyar felt indifferent about certain storylines himself. One of them, was his inability to talk with women throughout the show. Turns out, this was actually based on a real person and close friend of the creator. Nonetheless, the actor grew irritated not being able to contribute during certain scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was definitely frustrating because there were episodes where I knew I could contribute in ways [but] I was handicapped by the character’s issue,” he told TV Line.</p><p>Nayyar was annoyed by the fact that he would just have to sit around for long stretches of time without saying a word when females were present in a scene.</p><p>Once that finally changed, Nayyar was thrilled about the new possibilities.</p><p>“After a while, the freedom to be able to speak without that was really nice, just from an acting point of view.”</p><p>It was welcomed change not just for the fans, but Nayyar himself as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dl7aoecGapaBlpJ2ysL7YZpqrnZGpvLO%2FjKucoKqVqcGmsIypnKemqWKur7CMq5ijZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
