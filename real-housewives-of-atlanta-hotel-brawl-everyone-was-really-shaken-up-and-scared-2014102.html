"Scary" is also apt, one insider close to the Bravo smash tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly.</strong></a></p><p>"Everyone was really shaken up by that fight, and really very scared. The cast was scared, and production was scared," says the source of the fight, which involved several players and several intense, violent peaks. As established on the Feb. 2 episode, the trouble began when lingerie-clad hostess Leakes asked guests provocative party questions about their sex lives, relationships and romantic pasts. Oh, and to make matters even more scintillating: The "pillow talk" theme required all guests to wear sexy pajamas (think topless men and lingerie-clad ladies). "The cast had been drinking and jabs were being exchanged but no one thought it would get that headed."</p><p>After non-castmember Christopher Williams confronted <strong>Kenya Moore</strong> over claims she made about his marriage to wife <strong>Natalie</strong>, Moore's gay pal <strong>Brandon</strong> and Christopher got into a physical fight. <strong>Phaedra Parks</strong>' husband <strong>Apollo Nida</strong>, meanwhile, intervened to hold back Brandon. After Brandon struck Apollo, he retaliated violently, assailing him with repeated, furious punches. After that died down — segueing into the Feb. 9 episode — <strong>Kandi Buruss</strong> then confronted Christopher's wife Natalie over her own comments about Kandi's fiance, Todd. <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong> then interjected, which infuriated Kandi even more; when Cynthia's sister Mallory poked Kandi, all bets were off.</p><p>"Why are you all up in here?" she screamed. As other pals physically restrained her, she bellowed, "I'm a short girl … You cannot come up in my face doin' all this finger waving … so you better back up. I will f—— drag you in this!"</p><p>According to a second show insider, production had to intervene during multiple moments of the fight. "They jumped in and broke it up," the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. "The entire crew jumped in and they are on camera. They would have called the police but the crew broke it up first."</p><p>As Sunday's episode revealed, Burruss subsequently apologize to the women for her outburst — although the peace with Bailey seems an uneasy one, and neither Moore nor Parks offered up any apologies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, it seemed by the end of the Feb. 9 episode — with all the women hanging out during a girls' spa date — some of the women appeared to hold Moore the most accountable for "charging" Williams during the party, leading to the first of many confrontations. "You go ahead, girl," Leakes sniffed during a confessional. "You just stay there."</p><p>Tell Us: Who is the most to blame?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmemZxitbDB0p6uoq6VqHqwsoyaq6WZnqmubrTOrZylZZKnrri4jJ6tnqqppLumedaaqmaqlZa5rcWMrJ%2Bao5Wjera8jJqlnWWjmK6zscNmaWlpZGZ9c3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
