Most of the rumors stem from the drama that ensued when, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dexterto </a>reported in May this year, Tana called out <a href=#>Harry's ex, Francesca Farago</a>, for allegedly insisting she take down a video posted of her and Harry. Ironically, <a href=#>Tana and Francesca were also rumored to be dating at one point</a>- but we'll get back to that later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-gushes-over-tana>Harry Gushes Over Tana</h2><p>Well, Tana's business savvy, anyway. The THTH alum gushed, "the craziest thing is, she looks like she's drunk and having a good time online, but she's actually very business-oriented." Another thing that has him admiring her? "She's kept her same friends, which is extremely rare. A lot of people recycle friends every couple of months, but she keeps her day one friends around, takes them on private jets, and honestly, I aspire to be like that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>TikToker Josh Richards Thinks Tana Mongeau Is The Best Clout Chaser</a></span></p><p>Harry is certainly not shy when it comes to complimenting Tana, but the question remains - are they, or aren't they?</p><h2 id=how-harry-and-tana-started-hanging-out>How Harry And Tana Started Hanging Out</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tana-mongeau-bella-thorne-fight.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In light of Tana being linked to Francesca, it's understandable that the two may have felt slightly awkward around each other - at least when they first started seeing each other in a social setting. However, not one to make things weird (especially since the two were on the same party scene), Harry ultimately reached out, and the two started messaging each other. Eventually, he asked her to dinner, and (drum roll, please)..."we've been best friends ever since." So, there we have it.</p><h2 id=where-there-39-s-smoke-there-39-s-fire-or-is-there>Where There's Smoke, There's Fire...Or Is There?</h2><p>For the fans tempted to speculate on whether Harry and Tana are 'just' friends (and how long that might be the case), Harry had an answer to that, too. Asked whether they were ever tempted to be anything more, the Australian reality star simply shook his head. "Honestly, from day one, we were just homies. We both immediately knew it wasn't going anywhere," he explained. As for their flirting online, he added, "we play around with it on social media to keep people on their toes, but honestly, never been there, never plan to go there. It's black and white."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Wolf Of Wall Street' Legend Jordan Belfort Flirts With Tana Mongeau On Twitter</a></span></p><h2 id=harry-sets-the-rumors-straight-on-tana-and-francesca>Harry Sets The Rumors Straight On Tana And Francesca</h2><p>So, if there has never been anything between Harry and Tana, was the drama between the ladies all a farce? Well, Harry says their rumored relationship definitely was - and he insisted that Tana would back him up on that. He explained, "Tana will be the first to admit that she and Francesca were massively clout farming" when they were pictured together. In fact, Harry even alleged that they called the paparazzi on themselves.</p><p>That being said, when it comes to the falling out over Tana and Harry posting TikTok videos together, Harry explained that that particular issue was completely true - and as for a reconciliation, fans should think twice before holding their breath. He also shared that Tana had asked Francesca to box, and while the <a href=#>rumors that he himself would box fellow THTH star, Chase DeMoor</a>, were all in good fun (but also untrue), the same could not be said of the women. "They hate each other," he shared. "They absolutely hate each other."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'Too Hot To Handle' Star Chase DeMoor Reveals What Really Happened After His Split From Tabitha</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmn5qqoq56q7vWrJyyZaKaw6aty6xkraCVYsGzwdOhZJqan6rBbrTIrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdrLa1tIytmKeZXaK8r7PEmqxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
