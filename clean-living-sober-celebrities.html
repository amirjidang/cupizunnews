Here are 10 celebrities you didn't know were sober.</p><h2 id=tyler-the-creator>Tyler The Creator</h2><p><a href=#>Tyler The Creator</a> of Odd Future has described himself as a walking paradox. He is known to be a jack of all trades in all things creative. Not only is he a rapper, singer, and songwriter he is also a record producer, a fashion designer, and a graphic designer.</p><p>Although his music and visuals can be described as vulgar, very trippy, and hard to categorize, Tyler the creator is actually adamantly sober. He even&nbsp;bans drugs and alcohol from his music studio so as not to distract from his art.</p><h2 id=lucy-hale>Lucy Hale</h2><p><a href=#>Lucy Hale</a> is a 28-year-old actress and country singer from Memphis, Tennessee and is most well known for her role in the wildly popular book turned TV series, Pretty Little Liars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Diets Only Celebrities Can Afford</a></span></p><p>Earlier this year,&nbsp;Hale opened up about leaving alcohol behind and opting to sit out the famed Hollywood parties to spend more time with her dogs.

He has seen success in many big box office films like The Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Mad Max, and Venom.</p><p>However, things were not always so easy for Hardy. He admits that he began experimenting with drugs and alcohol in his teen years, had a few spells in jail and rehab.&nbsp;Hardy finally turned his life around in 2013 and has been sober since. In fact, he has now been sober longer than he was drinking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sia>Sia</h2><p>The Australian singer is known for her thoughtful songwriting and captivating music video direction. <a href=#>Sia</a> has been in the music industry for a while, but her rise to fame was a difficult one.
