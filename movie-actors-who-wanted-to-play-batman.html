Bruce Wayne has had so many different actors portray him, it's hard to even put a face to the character anymore. Because of that, it makes it so easy for fans to come up with endless fan casts, even if they aren't accurate to the comic books.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robert Pattinson isn't the only actor who was interested in playing the character. Batman has a long history, and any film with his name tagged along is most likely going to be a success that will bring plenty of newfound fame to the actor in the suit. Of course,&nbsp;many actors have been interested in driving the batmobile.</p><p>With the many actors tied to the Batman role, we decided to take a look at some of the major stars who really wanted the role and some of the other actors&nbsp;who would probably pull it off way better than Pattinson. Let's get started!</p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-always-wanted-to-play-batman><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Keanu Reeves Always Wanted To Play Batman</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MovieFone</a>, Batman was the role of Keanu Reeves' dreams.&nbsp;"I always wanted to play The Dark Knight, but I didn't get that one. They've had some great Batmans. So now I'm just enjoying them as an audience," Keanu Reeves stated. It seems like the DCEU missed&nbsp;out big time by not casting him, considering his Hollywood success now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-jonas-volunteered-to-replace-ben-affleck-on-social-media><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Nick Jonas Volunteered To Replace Ben Affleck&nbsp;On Social Media</span></h2><p>Nick Jonas was totally willing to play The Batman before Robert Pattinson snatched the role, and he made that perfectly clear on social media, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>. The youngest Jonas Brother member commented on a post questioning which actor should take on the role after Affleck, Jonas wrote, "First name Nick. Last name Jonas."</p><h2 id=henry-cavill-originally-auditioned-for-batman><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Henry Cavill Originally Auditioned For Batman</span></h2><p>Henry Cavill was desperately interested in a superhero role, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>. Apparently, Cavill had previously auditioned for the role of Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight before it went to Christian Bale. In a way, we're glad this one didn't work out because of his huge resemblance to Clark Kent.</p><h2 id=better-richard-madden-looks-more-like-a-young-bruce-wayne-than-robert-pattinson><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Better: Richard Madden Looks More Like A Young Bruce Wayne Than Robert Pattinson</span></h2><p>Richard Madden emulates Bruce Wayne from the comic books way more than Robert Pattinson does. If you've ever picked up a Batman comic, you would know he's most notably known for his deep dark hair and clear eyes, which Pattinson clearly doesn't fit the bill for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tim-burton-tried-to-get-his-friend-johnny-depp-the-part><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Tim Burton Tried To Get His Friend Johnny Depp The Part</span></h2><p>It's not surprising Johnny Depp was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">up for the role</a> of Batman back when Tim Burton was the director. Based on their track record, Johnny Depp is willing to take on any part as long as Burton is in charge. Unfortunately, the executives of the film didn't think it would be a great idea. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumor has it</a>, now Depp is being eyed for the Joker in The Batman!</p><h2 id=josh-brolin-almost-got-the-part-before-ben-affleck><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Josh Brolin Almost Got The Part Before Ben Affleck</span></h2><p>Once upon a time, Josh Brolin was interested in playing the hero instead of the menacing villain role he ended up taking when he portrayed Thanos. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comic Book Movie,</a> Brolin was in talks to star as Batman in Batman V. Superman, but ended up not being right for the part. Turns out, Brolin has no regrets about this and is grateful he didn't portray Bruce Wayne.</p><h2 id=armie-hammer-was-cast-as-batman-in-a-canceled-film><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Armie Hammer&nbsp;Was Cast As Batman In A Canceled Film</span></h2><p>Not only did Armie Hammer want to play Batman, but he was actually going to portray Bruce Wayne in the scrapped film titled Justice League: Mortal. This film was so close to being made, that there were even images surfacing of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">costume</a> he was supposed to wear. What a shame, we're sure Hammer would have been an excellent Bruce Wayne.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=better-ryan-gosling-can-certainly-out-brood-robert-pattinson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Better: Ryan Gosling Can Certainly Out-Brood Robert Pattinson</span></h2><p>Ryan Gosling is certainly known for his intense brooding stare, which is one thing Bruce Wayne is also most notable for. He may not have the same dark hair as the comic book Batman but hey, neither does Robert Pattinson. Out of the two, we can definitely see Gosling fitting the role way better than Pattinson.</p><h2 id=nicholas-hoult-almost-took-the-part-from-robert-pattinson><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nicholas Hoult Almost Took The Part From Robert Pattinson</span></h2><p>Nicholas Hoult and Robert Pattinson were both doing tests in the Batsuit during the audition process for The Batman, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>. Both Pattinson and Hoult were runner-ups for the role, and Hoult certainly came pretty close to putting on the Batsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 True Facts About Batman's New Penguin, Collin Farrell</a></span></p><h2 id=pierce-brosnan-says-he-regrets-turning-down-the-part><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Pierce Brosnan&nbsp;Says He Regrets Turning Down The Part</span></h2><p>Pierce Brosnan is most known for portraying James Bond, and if he had agreed to portray Bruce Wayne, he would have two iconic characters on his resume. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC</a>, Brosnan thought he wouldn't be taken seriously if he took on the role, but after he saw the success of the film, he clearly realized his mistake and wished he took the part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-hamm-thinks-the-batsuit-would-fit-him><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jon Hamm Thinks&nbsp;The Batsuit Would Fit Him</span></h2><p>"I'd probably fit the suit," Jon Hamm expressed his interest in playing Batman on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Graham Bensinger show,</a>&nbsp;"I have to work out a lot, which I don't love," he joked. Hamm is yet another common fan cast for the role, and we can easily see why. He's&nbsp;taken on plenty of darker roles, which makes him way more suitable for The Dark Knight than Robert Pattinson.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Storylines We Want To See In Matt Reeves' Upcoming Batman Films (And 5 We Don't)</a></span></p><h2 id=better-michael-fassbender-could-take-a-break-from-playing-villains-to-be-batman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Better: Michael Fassbender Could Take A Break From Playing Villains To Be Batman</span></h2><p>Michael Fassbender certainly has a knack for playing the bad guy. But those same intimidating features he has that make him the perfect villain, could easily make him an excellent choice to play The Dark Knight, too. If Robert Pattinson weren't in the role, Fassbender would definitely be the better choice!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jake-gyllenhaal-auditioned-for-the-dark-knight><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jake Gyllenhaal Auditioned For The Dark Knight</span></h2><p>Jake Gyllenhaal was ready to suit up, but he sadly didn't land the parts of either Batman or Spider-Man, which are the two superhero roles he auditioned for.&nbsp;"I was definitely open to both the roles. However, at a certain point, you realize there is always someone more interesting, talented and ready to do the role," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gyllenhaal stated</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Batman Villains That Should Be In The Next DC Film (And 10 That Shouldn't)</a></span></p><h2 id=jeffrey-dean-morgan-said-he-d-play-batman-if-given-the-chance><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan Said He'd Play Batman If Given The Chance</span></h2><p>"If there's a chance that they would ask me, I'd say yes." Jeffrey Dean Morgan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>&nbsp;about the possibility of him playing Batman in the upcoming Flashpoint movie. Although, he mentioned he'd love to see DC straighten things out a bit first. Morgan stated, "I'd like to see is a little continuity with DC, and then, man I'd be honored and love to do it more than anything."</p><h2 id=better-kit-harington-already-knows-how-to-play-a-hero><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Better: Kit Harington Already Knows How To Play A Hero</span></h2><p>Robert Pattinson may be experienced playing&nbsp;a vampire, but Kit Harington has some serious experience being a hero with his years on Game of Thrones. Harington has been a popular fan-cast of Bruce Wayne for a while and considering they were going for a younger Batman in the new film, Harrington would have definitely been a better option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Reasons Robert Pattinson Is The Perfect Batman (And 6 Legit Concerns)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikqK6Zmnqir9Ooqaxlp528bsPAp6uenF2pvG68y5qwZpqRqbqiuo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
