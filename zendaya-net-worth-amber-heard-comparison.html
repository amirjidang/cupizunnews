In what context did Zendaya come up in the trial? Fans of the Spider-Man star were not happy when entertainment expert Katherine Arnold compared Amber Heard's career to Zendaya's. The Euphoria actress is so famous she can be compared to such huge and mature celebs as <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> and <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, so putting her name next to Amber's doesn't seem reasonable. For example, while Amber Heard has 4.7 million Instagram followers, Zendaya has 142 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before landing roles in Disney original movies, 12-year-old Zendaya appeared in a Sears commercial with <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was another kid who desperately wanted to become a Disney star</a>. The entertainment conglomerate knew Zendaya was a good dancer, so the talented actress was the perfect choice for the channel's new project, Shake it Up. After the series ended, the star started exploring other facets of her career, reaching the level of fame she has today. Here's everything said about Zendaya during the trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.</p><h2 id=why-zendaya-39-s-name-came-up-in-the-johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-trial>Why Zendaya's Name Came Up In The Johnny Depp And Amber Heard Trial?</h2><p>In Katherine Arnold's analysis presented to the court before testifying, the entertainment expert estimated that <a href=#>Johnny Depp's 2019 defamation suit that led to the trial might have cost Amber $50 million</a> based on estimated earnings. Katherine also gave a list of comparable stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Couldn't Stop Laughing When Amber Heard's Team Brought This Up To A Disney Executive</a></span></p><p>The people she named similar to Amber were Chris Pine, Gal Gadot, Ana de Armas, Jason Momoa, and Zendaya. Johnny's lawyer, Wayne Dennison, begged to disagree with the comparisons and argued why Zendaya could not be compared to Amber. He said, "You indicated that another person that you compared Ms. Heard with is Zendaya, a person so famous she goes by one name."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That gave fans the first reason Zendaya and Amber cannot be comparable. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Not many people go by one name in Hollywood, and Zendaya is one of the few</a>. Dennison then mentioned her accomplishments, noting, "She's been on the Disney Channel since 13 years old, she's won an Emmy, she was singing and dancing and swinging from trapezes in The Greatest Showman. She's now been in multiple Spider-Man movies." It's clear that Amber's accomplishments in the film industry are nowhere near Zendaya's achievements.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-39-s-lawyer-wayne-dennison-defended-zendaya-during-the-trial>Johnny Depp's Lawyer Wayne Dennison Defended Zendaya During The Trial</h2><p>Dennison went on to give another reason why Zendaya and Amber Heard should not even be compared. He said, "she's ten years younger than your clients, but this is a person you deem comparable." Hollywood's entertainment lawyer Richard Marks also took the stand and disagreed with the comparisons. He testified in court that Katherine's comments were wildly speculative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He claimed that <a href=#>Amber Heard's career could not be compared to the likes of Jason Momoa</a> and Zendaya and justified the argument by citing Momoa's role in Game of Thrones and Zendaya's strong one-name branding. When asked if Amber was comparable to the people the entertainment expert listed, Marks said, "again, they are not comparable. Jason Momoa was Aquaman, Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman." Then he added, "Zendaya has been working on the Disney Channel since she was 13; she's in all the Spider-Man movies."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Even Zendaya Can't Help But To Laugh During These 'Euphoria' Outtakes</a></span></p><p>Richard also blasted Amber when he said she had to test or audition for the part of Mera in Aquaman, which affected her earning capacity. According to Marks, an established actor usually wouldn't test; they'd be offered the role. But Amber was in a group of actors that needed to be tested to see if the studio wanted to hire them. And then, if they hired them, they'd be locked up for potentially four movies at a very lucrative increase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-zendaya-39-s-fans-are-absolutely-furious-with-amber-heard>Why Zendaya's Fans Are Absolutely Furious With Amber Heard?</h2><p>The bottom line, Amber and Zendaya are not comparable, and fans on social media seem to agree. As for Zendaya, the actress did not respond to the comparison directly, but followers said that she probably also couldn't believe the audacity. One person wrote, "I didn't know Amber Heard before this trial. That's how famous she is."</p><p>Another user agreed by saying, "Comparing Zendaya to Amber Heard is an absolute INSULT & a HUGE slap in the face to Zendaya! At acting skills can't even begin to compare to what Zendaya has done. Zendaya has worked her a** off, putting in work to grow her career without getting involved in scandals, while that's all AH will ever be known for is her scandalous behavior. One is a true star while the other is a stepping stone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While on the stand, Amber Heard's agent, Jessica Kovacevic, said that Amber's role in Aquaman should have led to more roles in TV and films along with endorsement deals. However, besides Aquaman 2, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heard has shot only a single independent film, In the Fire</a>, in the last two years. Kovacevic said, "they just don't want to hire someone that has bad press around them from these accusations." However, most fans agree that Amber's lack of acting skills could be a more reasonable explanation.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Amber Heard Has $1 Million Getaway Home In The Desert Ready For Her Post-Trial Escape</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGixnqaUlsaiec2eq2avn6fBqXnAppmeql2dsqK%2Bw2aaqKWglr%2Bqv86nZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
