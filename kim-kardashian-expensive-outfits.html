The last decade has seen Kim Kardashian&nbsp;dabble in just&nbsp;about everything within the beauty industry, but her focus on style has never wavered. Before she and her family entered our homes, via their reality show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she was a fashion buyer for celebrities like Paris Hilton. As Kim's own fame expanded, her much-coveted style became central to her popularity. These days, pretty much every outfit Kim wears is widely talked about and coveted by the public—especially the expensive pieces. Here are 10 of Kim Kardashian's most expensive outfits ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Secrets About Kim Kardashian Her Ex-Assistant Revealed After She Was Let Go</a></span></p><h2 id=archived-chanel-swimsuit---priceless>Archived Chanel Swimsuit - Priceless</h2><p>22Kim Kardashian has been on the ultimate vintage kick the last few months. While every other big name in Hollywood seems keen on showing off the latest looks from the biggest fashion houses, Kim is living happily in the past—not that we blame her. When you probably have first dibs on nearly every current designer, the only way to really make a splash is to go back in time. For Kim, that time seems to be the 90s. The beauty maven completely broke the internet last year when she posted photos of herself in a vintage Chanel bikini that left very little to the imagination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thierry-mugler-cutout-gown---priceless>Thierry Mugler Cutout Gown - Priceless</h2><p>Kim Kardashian is known for her risky, body-baring looks. So, it's really saying something when she can wear a dress that still shocks and surprises. Cue the archived Thierry Mugler cut-out dress Kim arrived in Hollywood's Beauty Awards at. The dress originally appeared on the runway during Mugler's 1998 Haute Couture Spring show.&nbsp; The dress's focal point is its cutouts, which extend over the chest area. For as much of a splash as the dress originally made so many years ago, it's clear that Kim's take on the look breathed new life into it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Auctions Off Clothes For Children's Charity</a></span></p><h2 id=wool-jacket-and-neutrals---15-790>Wool&nbsp;Jacket And Neutrals - $15,790</h2><p>Sometimes, less is more. At least aesthetically. Kim Kardashian's above look is nothing special, upon first glance. A black blouse, nude heels, and a long, Black coat usually wouldn't warrant a second look on Kim—or anyone for that matter—but it's actually one of her more expensive looks ever. E! broke down each of Kim's pricey items, which consist of a $4,350 Givenchy wool coat, $695 Guiseppe Zanotti Heels, and a $10,000 black Birkin Bag. Given that Kim was photographed in LAX it makes sense that she would dress down. Why she opted for such expensive items probably boils down to the fact that she's, well, extremely rich.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birkin-bag---50-000>Birkin Bag -$50,000</h2><p>The rich might breathe the same air as us, but they live completely different lives. Most mothers shell out around $50 for a quality diaper bag, but that wasn't good enough for Kim Kardashian. Instead, Kim made headlines when she revealed that she used her $50,000 Birkin Bag as a diaper bag for North West (which, as it turns out, isn't quite so uncommon among the elite). While it seems absolutely bonkers to use what amounts as the down payment on a really nice house to hold baby wipes and goldfish crackers, Kim's proved, time and time again, that she's not exactly like the rest of us.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Secrets About Kim Kardashian Her Sisters Won't Want You To Know</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yeezys---90-000>Yeezys&nbsp;- $90,000</h2><p>Kim Kardashian is married to Kanye West, creator and face of the&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;popular Yeezy Sneakers. That's why it comes as no surprise that she has a pair or two of the shoes in her closet. It came as a massive surprise, however, when Kim revealed that she had a pair of $90,000 Yeezys in her closet, however. While most Yeezys retail for a couple of hundred dollars, a few limited-edition versions of Yeezy II's warranted a $90,000 price tag in some online auctions. Kim, of course, scored a pair, though it's probably safe to assume she didn't actually have to pay for them.</p><h2 id=custom-vera-wang-wedding-gown---priceless>Custom Vera Wang Wedding&nbsp;Gown - Priceless</h2><p>Kim Kardashian's marriage to Chris Humphries may have barely lasted two months, but the wedding photos from their big day have proved to be timeless. Even all these years later, Kim Kardashian looked absolutely stunning in the classic ballgown she walked down the aisle. Despite fervent searches, there's no word on just how much the custom Vera Wang gown cost, which puts in proudly in our "priceless" category.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vintage-jean-paul-gaultier---priceless>Vintage Jean Paul Gaultier - Priceless</h2><p>Jean Paul Gaultier—or at least his social media manager—famously called Kim Kardashian out for copying the design of his Classique perfume bottles for her own fragrance brand, KKW Body Perfurme. Yet, that did nothing to absolve Kim's love for the brand. Just a few months later, Kim Kardashian was spotted out in vintage Jean Paul Gaultier. The beauty maven pulled out the skin-tight printed dress for the opening of&nbsp;UCLA’s Robert G. Kardashian Center, in honor of her late father, Robert Kardashian Sr.</p><h2 id=givenchy-wedding-gown---500-000>Givenchy Wedding Gown - $500,000</h2><p>They say the third time's the charm, and Kim Kardashian's third marriage (to Kanye West) is proving to be the one that may very last for a lifetime. It only makes sense that her third wedding dress was the most extravagant and expensive. Though Kim Kardashian rocked three different dresses for her&nbsp;2014 wedding to Kanye West, it's the $500,000 Givenchy Gown that she walked down the aisle in that caught everyone's attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vintage-versace-mini---priceless>Vintage Versace Mini - Priceless</h2><p>Kim Kardashian usually crushes her fashion competition, but the help of sparkly vintage Versace number literally had her shining brighter than the rest. Last last year, Mrs. Kanye West headed out to a Versace Fashion show wearing Vintage Versace, which she paired with clear Yeezy heels. The dress was first introduced as part of Gianni Versace's 1997 Winter Runway show.&nbsp; The dress appears to&nbsp;quite similar to a dress that&nbsp;former BFF, Paris Hilton wore for her 21st birthday.</p><h2 id=ring---4-5-million>Ring - $4.5 Million</h2><p>Marie Claire reports that Kanye West gifted Kim with the above pictured $4.5 million Lorraine Schwartz diamond ring to commemorate their engagement in late 2016. Kim Kardashian infamously flashed the ring on Instagram, just days before her 2016 Paris Robbery, which left her without millions of dollars in jewelry and other personal objects. It's been speculated that Kim's decision to bring attention to it was&nbsp;what put her on the thieve's radars in the first place. While it's unfortunate that Kim had to endure such a traumatic experience, it's easy to see why anyone want to get their hands on such a gorgeous—and expensive—piece of jewelry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>20 Outfits That Kanye Clearly Told Kim Kardashian To Wear</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWacsaiVo8CqwsRmpq6slp7BtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
