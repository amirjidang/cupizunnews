Happy 5th Birthday. I really can’t believe you’re 5!” the Skims founder, 42, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Sunday, January 13. “I’m so so <a href=#>proud to be your mom</a>, it’s the best feeling in the entire world. You are the cuddliest sweetest silliest most independent caring girl in the whole world and I just love you so much!”</p><p><strong><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a></strong> commented, “Def your twin,” while <a href=#><strong>Foodgod</strong></a> (born Jonathan Cheban) added, “Happy Birthday Chi!!! 🎈 the cutest!”</p><p>Grandma<a href=#><strong> Kris Jenner</strong></a> also shared a tribute on Sunday before the party got started. “Happy birthday to my beautiful granddaughter Chi Chi!!!!! 🎂❤️🎂❤️,” the momager wrote via Instagram Story. “You are our little doll who lights up every room! You bring the sunshine and the smiles every day and are so kind, sweet, loving, artistic, creative, generous, funny, and give the best hugs! You are the most amazing daughter, granddaughter, sister, cousin, niece, and friend! And I am so blessed God chose me to be your grandmother!!! I love you more than you will ever know!!!! Lovey xoxo.”</p><p>Then, it was time to celebrate. Chicago wore pink braids in her hair for her 5th birthday, which matched the decor of her <a href=#>Hello Kitty</a>-themed party. Guests were greeted by pink balloon trees and balloons of the iconic cartoon character, and there was plenty of food. The milkshake bar created Instagram-worthy beverages while waffle pops were a sweet snack. Kids also munched on crustless grilled cheese with pink filling while adults could enjoy the ramen bar, a nod to Hello Kitty’s Japanese origins.</p><p>There were plenty of activities for Chicago and her friends. Two slides led into a giant ball pit for playtime and stuffed white kittens were waiting on one table to be decorated with custom shirts. There was a station to make slime and a table where ceramic Hello Kitty piggy banks could be painted.</p><p>Khloe shared video of the birthday girl being serenaded as she blew out her birthday candles. Siblings <a href=#>North</a>, 9, <a href=#>Saint</a>, 7, and <a href=#>Psalm</a>, 3, were all in attendance along with Kris, 67.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>It isn’t clear if dad Kanye West attended. The rapper, 45, married the SKKN By Kim founder in 2014. Kim filed for divorce in 2021 and the pair were declared single in March 2022 before their split was finalized in December 2022.</p><p>The “Power” performer is at the center <a href=#>of wedding rumors</a>.
