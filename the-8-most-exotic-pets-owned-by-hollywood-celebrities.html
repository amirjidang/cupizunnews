You undoubtedly know a lot of people who have either cats or dogs as pets (or maybe even parrots or fish). There are definitely some people who have hamsters, ducks, or rabbits as pets. It's possible that you know someone who lives on a farm and keeps animals like horses, sheep, or goats as pets. However, only a small number of people, including some of your favorite celebrities, have exotic pets. Are you curious about which <a href=#>celebs have unusual pets</a>? Here are the 8 most exotic pets owned by a-list celebs.</p><h2 id=slash-s-boa-constrictor>Slash’s Boa Constrictor</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pet snakes are popular among many individuals. However, most people do not keep snakes as enormous or venomous as the ones Slash has decided to keep as pets. According to Reptile Magazine, Slash is captivated by boas and pythons and has kept a number of snakes in his home. In fact, he has kept a number of enormous Burmese pythons and a Pandora boa constrictor. For those who don’t know, Pandora rose to prominence after appearing in the music video for Guns N' Roses' song "Patience" in 1989.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-s-chimpanzee>Kim Kardashian’s Chimpanzee</h2><p>During the third season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian surprised her family by adopting a chimpanzee as a pet</a>. Suzy, the chimpanzee, was three years old. As Kardashian noted at the time on her blog, “Having a monkey is a lot of work. Suzy always has her diaper on, and we are the ones who have to change it!” Kardashian's post proved controversial, and not just because she wrote about Suzy days after a chimpanzee attacked a lady in Connecticut. Later, Kardashian explained that the chimpanzee was merely rented for a week as a prank on Kris Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanilla-ice-s-kangaroo>Vanilla Ice’s Kangaroo</h2><p>Vanilla Ice is renowned for keeping a pet kangaroo. People were unaware that the rapper had a kangaroo until Bucky escaped by accident. He also has a goat. The goat opened the gate with his head, and they both exited to run around. The goat and kangaroo were never separated. Vanilla Ice was in London at the time and was unaware that Bucky had escaped until he went on the television and saw the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kangaroo on the news</a>. “I called animal control and let them know who it was — and it became this big deal. I’m still laughing at it,” he said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are The 10 Most Expensive Dog Breeds In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=paris-hilton-s-kinkajou>Paris Hilton’s Kinkajou</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The kinkajou is a small rainforest mammal that is related to raccoons and known as a honey bear. People stated that this species is prohibited in California, despite the fact that Paris Hilton notably owns it. Baby Luv, according to Jezebel, first garnered prominence in 2006 when it bit Hilton. According to reports, Hilton headed to the medical hospital after the event. The Associated Press reports that Hilton had a tetanus vaccine. In 2010, however, Ace Showbiz revealed that the animal was still living with her. In reality, two kinkajous resided on her ranch.</p><h2 id=kirstie-alley-s-lemur>Kirstie Alley’s Lemur</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kirstie Alley does not own cats or dogs, but she has <a href=#>one of the most expensive pets</a>. According to People, Alley actually owns fourteen of these small Madagascar-native primates. However, she does not suggest them as pets. What's the reason? She told People that lemurs can live for at least 30 years, that they eat only organic foods, and that they require attentive care. Alley has discovered that lemurs are calm and enjoy being around people. She revealed to Rachael Ray that she pretended one of her lemurs was a cat in order to transport it through an airport.</p><h2 id=tippi-hedren-s-lion>Tippi Hedren’s Lion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tippi Hedren has become as well-known for her animal rights activism and conservation efforts as for her film roles. According to Time, Hedren established the Roar Foundation and the Shambala Preserve for large big cats, such as lions, leopards, bobcats, and servals. However, not many know that she owns one of the <a href=#>most wildly expensive celebrity pets</a>. Hedren owned a lion named Neil in her home throughout the 1970s. Neil even shared a bed with Melanie Griffith, Hedren's teenage daughter, on occasions. The lion had complete access to the home. Hedren has now "acknowledged that putting her family at risk by unleashing an animal with "no conscience or remorse genes" was "beyond stupid." Hedren explains that Neil never caused harm to her family. She writes in her memoir, "We should have never taken those risks."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Suite Life Of Pets: 12 Celebrity Pets Who Are As Famous As Their Owners</a></span></p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-s-miniature-donkeys>Reese Witherspoon’s Miniature Donkeys</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that donkeys aren't all that rare on a farm. However, they are not <a href=#>popular pets in Hollywood</a>, particularly miniature donkeys. According to People, Reese Witherspoon has two miniature donkeys named Honky and Tonky. Pigs, goats, a horse, dogs, and chickens are among the several farm animals owned by Witherspoon. Meanwhile, her neighbors apparently complained about the donkeys' noise. However, her neighbors did not want her to leave.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-s-monkey>Justin Bieber’s Monkey</h2><p>It may not occur to you that Justin Bieber would possess an exotic pet or any pet at all. However, customs officials confiscated his capuchin monkey, OG Malley, when Bieber arrived in Munich for a tour stop. The event was the subject of significant speculation. The German government provided Bieber with a deadline for retrieving Malley. After being captured, the monkey was eventually transported to a zoo.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Swarovski Story: How It Became One Of The Biggest Names In Luxury</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jungle Roots</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGZwXaK8tMCMnq%2BorJmYerGx06xkqK%2BemrFurthmn6iknK7EsLvDZpqepJWXv6rAyJ6qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
