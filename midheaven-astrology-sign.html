To learn your own midheaven astrology sign, look at your natal chart to find a vertical line at the top with a little "MC" above it. This stands for medium coeli, Latin for "middle of the sky," and it marks the zodiac sign that was directly overhead (or midheaven) at the exact moment you were born.<p>"The midheaven relates to our ambition and can be a good indicator to how our biggest achievements will occur in our life," says astrologer <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://themoonshineco.com/about-corina/>Corina Crysler</a>. "The MC can also be where we set goals and what we aspire to achieve."

The MC can also be where we set goals and what we aspire to achieve." —astrologer Corina Crysler.</p><p>While MC and career can go hand-in-hand, your midheaven astrology sign isn't only about the calling that earns you money. For example, my midheaven is in Gemini, and my career—as a writer who communicates information—is reflective of that. My side hobby of posting sardonic Facebook statuses about <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/adult-living-with-parents/>living with my parents at age 29</a> is not&nbsp;part of my career, but judging by the volume of laugh-react emojis they garner, I believe it's another way that I'm fulfilling my Gemini MC destiny.</p><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><a v-on:click.prevent="trackLinkGA($event, key)" :href=post.url data-url-source=related-content class=related-content__link referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url href=#><img :src=post.image_url :alt=post.title src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/midheaven-astrology-sign/ style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>Want to learn more?

Then, read on to find out how to use your midheaven astrology sign to find and live your purpose.</p><h2>Here's what your midheaven astrology sign says about your higher calling in the world.</h2><h3>Midheaven in Aries</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Aries.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Aries are the zodiac wheel's initiators. They tend to be very goal-focused, competitive, and are typically drawn to roles that promise growth and adventure. "This <a href=# referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-vars-event="body text" data-vars-click-url=https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-the-fire-signs/>fire sign</a> is all about movement and starting new projects, which will be infused with excitement," says Crysler. "This is someone with a lot of courage and determination and no task will seem unachievable." She adds that this person should avoid roles in which they'll be micromanaged.</p><h3>Midheaven in Taurus</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Taurus.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Taurus rules authenticity, so Crysler says it's important for this person to be seen for who they are. Staying true to their good, steady, and reliable work ethic will likely pay off. "They are good with money and could choose a career around this," Crysler says.&nbsp; This midheaven sign, in particular, should approach their goals with a methodical plan in place. "They need to feel secure and grounded in their achievements. It may take them a little longer to get there, but when they do, they tend to do it successfully," says Crysler.</p><h3>Midheaven in Gemini</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Gemini.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Gemini midheavens are known to be excellent communicators, and therefore excel when it comes to speaking or writing. "They typically can see trends and are clever in their delivery," says Crysler. "They have a wonderful ability to multi-task and thrive on diversity in their projects. Any path of learning and discovery will be a happy one for this MC." The only downside to this placement? They can sometimes burn out from taking on too many projects that inspire them.</p><h3>Midheaven in Cancer</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Cancer.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>"Cancer [MC]’s nurturing disposition makes them the ultimate caregiver," Crysler says. "They love to create beautiful spaces and a comfortable atmosphere." A career in hospitality or interior design could make sense for this person—or they could find their ultimate purpose in parenting, as Cancer rules maternal energy. No matter which path they choose, it's important&nbsp; to have energetic boundaries in place. "Be mindful of holding onto suffering, as this sensitive water MC tends to be affected emotionally by others," Crysler says.</p><h3>Midheaven in Leo</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Leo.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Leo energy is always closely tied to creative work, often in a very public-facing way. (Think actors, artists, or singers.) This pleasure-seeking sign must learn to stay the course even when the road gets rocky, says Crysler. "It's important to not lose faith in your dreams. Use your creative nature to pivot and problem-solve, and, more importantly, don't give up. Learn to keep your ego in check, and listen to those who have constructive feedback."</p><h3>Midheaven in Virgo</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Virgo.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Those with their midheaven in Virgo have the potential to be a powerful force in wellness or healing. Crysler says they intuitively know what someone needs to rest and recover, and their love of routine allows them to help others find a personal path to well-being. "Structure is important to this sign and they make excellent problem-solvers," says the astrologer. "But be aware of perfectionism, and [make sure] that it doesn't prevent you from moving forward. Just get started."</p><h3>Midheaven in Libra</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Libra.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Libra is all about equality and bringing things into balance, so those with this midheaven sign could be phenomenal mediators, counselors, or lawyers. Their natural likability and people skills could also help them go far in interpersonal professions. "Ruled by Venus, this charming sign can attract great partnerships," says Crysler. "Just be mindful of how much you give to others, as it may be draining your life force."</p><h3>Midheaven in Scorpio</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Scorpio.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Scorpios live to pull back the veil on what's hidden, which means that those with this midheaven sign can make excellent therapists and investigators. Spiritual professions may suit them as well. "Many psychics, mediums, and energy workers have this MC, as they have a deep inner knowing," says Crysler. "This midheaven sign can work in areas that may be uncomfortable for many, but they thrive on the unknown. Anything 'surface' will be super-boring for Scorpio MC."</p><h3>Midheaven in Sagittarius</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Sagittarius.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>A Sagittarius MC is someone who marches to the beat of their own drum: an offbeat teacher, a philosopher, a world traveler (you know, in happier times). "This MC does not worry about what others think of them. They are going to create their own method or modality, as their desire is to become the master of their craft," says Crysler. Freedom is essential for this midheaven astrology sign, so they should avoid any role that would constrain them in any way.</p><h3>Midheaven in Capricorn</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Capricorn.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>With a natural entrepreneurial spirit, Capricorn midheavens know what they want and what they have to do to get it done. "This intelligent Earth MC is the master of structure, systems, and logistics," says Crysler. "Their extreme ambition and need to be their own boss typically outweighs anything that stands in their way." Feeling pessimistic or bogged down by the hustle? Crysler recommends tapping into your creativity to lighten things up.</p><h3>Midheaven in Aquarius</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Aquarius.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>With a philanthropic spirit, Aquarian MCs thrive on contributing to the collective. "They make excellent visionaries and inventors and have great ability to channel in ideas, especially around technology or mathematics," says Crysler. "This MC can't stand bureaucracy or too many rules. Therefore, aspire to have flexibility in whatever you do." That said, don't shy away from formal job settings because they seem stiff—you can still find fulfillment in group projects or networking.</p><h3>Midheaven in Pisces</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Horoscope-Slides-Set-1-Pisces.jpg alt width=870 height=572 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Someone with a dreamy Pisces midheaven would likely be highly intuitive and eager to to utilize their creative side. "They typically are great at design and artistry," Crysler says, adding that they'd also do well in spiritual or healing professions. Public-facing roles, however, are not necessarily their jam. "Pisces [MCs] need their space and being the center of attention is not the most comfortable position for them," says Crysler. They're happiest when making things rather than managing their image—and who can fault them for that?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHLpZinnJekvKV6wqikaKWZmbWmrdWepWaZo6m%2FsLjOoLBmq5mcu3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
