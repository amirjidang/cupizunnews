He’s also off social media for the most part.</p><p>Even his Instagram account – which boasts over three million followers – says: “Robert Kardashian does not post to this account. Account is run by Jenner Communications.”</p><p><strong>Updated, November 2023:</strong> For the most part, Rob Kardashian has continued to shy away from the spotlight constantly trained on his family.</p><p>However, on October 30th, Rob was the subject of entertainment news – specifically, a story about his mother <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> sharing Kardashian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">family photographs to Instagram for Halloween</a>. British tabloid The Sun reported that Jenner's post coincided with a "surprise appearance" featuring Rob Kardashian on the family's Hulu show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob "made a voice appearance on the show via a phone call with Kris, but fans were infuriated by how the events unfolded," after Kris Jenner posed an explicit question about his former brother-in-law Scott Disick's love life.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Rob-Kardashian-Withdraws-5-Year-Lawsuit-Against-Daughters-Mom-Blac-Chyna-.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Rob Kardashian Withdraws 5-Year Lawsuit Against Daughter's Mom Blac Chyna</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite Rob's request for dismissal, Chyna remains locked in multiple lawsuits involving the Kardashian-Jenner clan.</span><p>With Rob largely out of the public eye, it’s led many to wonder how he’s affording to keep up with his family’s luxurious lifestyle – Rob is reportedly worth $10 million.</p><p>Below, we take an insider look into <a href=#>how Rob makes a living away from the cameras</a>.</p><h2 id=career-on-reality-television>Career On Reality Television</h2><p>There was a time when Rob was a regular on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. One report claimed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was making $50,000 per episode</a> at one time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob also appeared on <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>’s spin-off show Khloe & Lamar, and had a stint on Dancing with the Stars.</p><p>He even had his own reality show briefly with his then-fiancé Blac Chyna, called Rob & Chyna. While it was canceled after two seasons (following the couple’s break-up), Rob could have easily raked in a six-figure profit from the show.</p><p>Rob isn't involved with his family’s new Hulu show The Kardashians (for the most part), and remains likely to keep his distance.</p><p>But it’s possible that Rob is making royalties off old reality show episodes he’s starred in. Residuals would likely form a small but significant portion of his income, based on the popularity of its early seasons.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rob-Kardashian-Tyga-Deny-Blac-Chynas-Claims-They-Dont-Support-Their-Kids.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Rob Kardashian & Tyga Deny Blac Chyna's Claims They Don't Support Their Kids</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Both Rob and Tyga said they have their children the majority of the week in addition to paying all school fees.</span><h2 id=rob-owns-multiple-businesses>Rob Owns Multiple Businesses</h2><p>Like his sisters, Rob owns a variety of businesses that provide him with a steady income stream.</p><p>He owns Grandeza hot sauce, sock company Arthur George, and Halfway Dead, a clothing brand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=six-figure-social-media-collaborations>Six-Figure Social Media Collaborations</h2><p>Even though Rob doesn’t post to his own Instagram account, there are occasional updates shared to it, some of which are promotional.</p><p>Like many with a large social following, the Kardashian-Jenner family is notorious for promoting brands and products online in exchange for a fee and commission.</p><p>The family can earn millions from a single social media post. Sister <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> has <a href=#>reportedly earned as much as $1.8 million</a> for an Instagram post, while <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> has made $1.6 million.</p><p>Rob has significantly [fewer] followers than his sisters. Kylie, for example, is one of the most followed people on Instagram, currently sitting with 382 million followers.</p><p>So, it’s unlikely that he makes a million per social media post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Rob still does have social platforms with millions of followers as well as a very famous name to use to his advantage.</p><p>So, he likely earns a pretty penny from social media collaborations.</p><h2 id=rob-rsquo-s-family-helps-him-financially-too>Rob’s Family Helps Him Financially, Too</h2><p>Rob may have a few streams of income thanks to his business profits and social media collaborations, but his family has stepped in to help him pay for things in the past.</p><p>In a 2016 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Rob’s sisters got angry at their mother after they learned Kris was buying a house for Rob.</p><p>They said that at the age of 30, Rob ought to be buying his own house.</p><p>Kim said, “ <a href=#>You should not be paying for your son</a> that is almost 30 years old to buy a house.” Then Khloe added, “Drop him. Cut the cord.”</p><p>Kris eventually gifted a mansion to Rob that she bought for $2.285 million. He sold it a year later (in 2017) for $2.44 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was also a time that Rob <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crashed at his sister Khloe’s home</a> for an extended period of time while she was married to <a href=#>Lamar Odom</a>.</p><p>“Rob lives with me now and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I love having him with me,” Khloe confirmed in 2015.</p><p>It’s unclear to what extent Rob’s family is helping him out financially, if at all. But the Kardashian-Jenners have proven they’ll go to great lengths to help their family members.</p><p>So, if Rob was in a difficult position – or they just wanted him to be able to afford a luxurious family trip – it wouldn’t be surprising if they helped him foot the bill.</p><h2 id=he-can-afford-20-000-in-child-support>He Can Afford $20,000 In Child Support</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another sign that Rob isn’t necessarily struggling financially is how much child support he was once ordered to pay to former partner Blac Chyna, to support Dream.</p><p>At one point, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the reality star was paying $20,000 a month</a> in child support. In California, it’s typical for a noncustodial parent to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to pay roughly 25 percent of their income</a> toward child support.</p><p>If Rob Kardashian's purported $20,000 child support obligation was based on his average monthly income, the figure suggests he averaged around $80,000 per month in income not otherwise exempted from such calculations.</p><p>Extrapolating from that standard percentage suggests Rob's child support obligations were based on income just under six figures a month.</p><p>However, the child support arrangement was revised in 2019, after it was determined Rob covered the majority of his daughter’s living expenses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaenYr%2BwroykmKuckai1qq3NZqSao5Woeqm10makqKaVrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
