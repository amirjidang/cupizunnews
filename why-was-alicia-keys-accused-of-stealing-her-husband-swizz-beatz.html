Here's the lowdown on the Grammy winner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who has sold 47 million records</a>, and her relationship with Swizz Beatz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-alicia-keys-meet-swizz-beatz>When Did Alicia Keys Meet Swizz Beatz?</h2><p>According to reports, Alicia Keys met Swizz Beatz, real name Kasseem Dean, when they were teenagers in the ‘90s, and though they’re madly in love now, things were quite different back then, with Keys telling Marie Claire UK that she didn’t have much of an attraction to her man when they first crossed paths.</p><p>"Honestly, I didn't really like him that much,” she told the publication back in 2013. "I thought he was too ostentatious. Swizz will have the fastest car, the biggest jewelry, the loudest jacket. Everything with his is really over the top. I used to see him and think, 'He is so annoying.’"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres And Alicia Keys Celebrate The Passing Of Breonna’s Law</a></span></p><p>Well, Beatz certainly wasn’t annoying to Keys when he reentered her life around 2009, which was the same year his ex-wife would accuse the Grammy award-winning singer of being a home-wrecker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who had destroyed a family by making moves on a married man</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tifrere, in a lengthy statement on Twitter, wrote: "My concern with [Alicia Keys] is no longer the fact that she assisted in destroying a family but that she has the audacity to make these selfish comments about love and wanting to be with someone, even after knowing their situation.</p><p>I feel that after [one] and a half years of you hiding this affair and acting like it [doesn't] exist, that now is the time to confront it, since you talk so openly about it now... You have no idea how much pain I was caused because of this affair.”</p><p>Beatz and Tifrere are believed to have separated in 2009, just one year after the latter had found out that her then-husband had shared an affair with Jahna Sebastian, subsequently leading to the news he had fathered a daughter named Nicole.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia Keys Reveals Her Inner Beauty While Teaching Young Girls To Do The Same</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, infidelity was already the case in Tifrere’s relationship before Keys came in the picture, but it seemed as if Beatz hadn’t completely cut ties with his ex until things were beginning to get serious with the R&B superstar.</p><p>In 2011, Keys defended herself against allegations that she had been seeing her husband while he was still with his ex, which she branded as false accusations in an interview with Essence magazine.</p><p>"We didn't start seeing each other until months after they had separated," she stressed. ”I was aware of all the false things that were being said about me. It definitely hurt."</p><p>Luckily for the trio, as time went by, they were able to have a sit-down and talk out their issues, which Tifrere spoke about in a 2018 interview with People magazine, adding that the idea of being on good terms with the couple seemed absurd at first, but through plenty of prayer and meditation, they all made peace with one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What Oprah Said About Alicia Keys’ New Book</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It took two years into our blending to make it happen, but when we did it was like turning the light on,” she gushed. “We realized we could minimize the impact on our children by reducing the conflict we had with one another. There were never any big blowouts. There were times when we didn’t fully agree, but we were all comfortable just letting it go.”</p><p>While it’s unclear to what exact date the reconciliation came about, it should be noted that Keys released a song, titled Blended Family, and during its promotional run, she said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was celebrating her husband’s ex-wife</a> on the Mark Batson-produced track.</p><p>"The understanding, compassion, and support we’ve found is a powerful testament to the healing that comes when we choose love," Keys said in her website announcement of the song. "Especially for the kids … the most important part of our lives. Celebrating Mashonda for our commitment to each other with support and true growth.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Pics Of Alicia Keys Embracing Her No Makeup Look</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60ecCloJyhkWK4psXSZpicm6WosqV5zp9krKyVlrmqusZmn56qXZ3CtK7Ap5tmq6eex7t5wZ6YrbJf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
