She was initially sashayed away in episode 4 but was able to return to the competition after winning the "Conjoined Twins" challenge with Pearl Liaison. Her participation in the race officially ended in episode 10, placing sixth in the competition. But in a true queenly manner, she did not stop fighting for the crown and won the third season of Rupaul's Drag Race: All Stars in 2018. Since then, she would become the <a href=#>second richest drag queen in the world</a>, right next to RuPaul himself. As of 2021, Mattel's estimated net worth is $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her career on TV, Mattel forayed into various projects that continue to earn her more money and fame. <a href=#>She has her own beauty line</a> Trixie Cosmetics, her own YouTube channel, web series featuring other drag queens, podcasts, and a book called Trixie and Katya's Guide to Modern Womanhood which she co-authored with fellow RPDR alumna, Katya Zamolodchikova. Throughout these <a href=#>huge post-RPDR successes</a>, Mattel has had her boyfriend, David Silver as a solid support system. He's even played a role in some of her creative projects. Here's what we know about Mattel's boyfriend of three years and her life off-drag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What We Know About ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Judge Carson Kressley's Relationship History</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-trixie-mattel-off-drag>Who Is Trixie Mattel Off-Drag?</h2><p>Born Brian Michael Firkus, Trixie Mattel was a persona created by a boy from Crivitz, Wisconsin whose abusive father would call him "Trixie" when he acted feminine. After getting a BFA in Music Theatre at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Firkus was cast in the production of The Rocky Horror Show at the Oriental Theatre where he was first exposed to the drag scene.</p><p>In 2008, Firkus began performing in drag. Trixie Mattel made her debut at LaCage Nightclub in Milwaukee. She gradually established her name in the local drag scene and in Chicago where other Drag Race stars like Kim Chi also had their acts. By late 2014, Mattel dropped out of The Institute of Beauty and Wellness to join season 7 of Rupaul's Drag Race.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trixie Mattel is based on Firkus' love for Barbie Dolls. The vegetarian entertainer has a vast collection of Barbies featured on some of her YouTube videos. But did you know that Mattel is not just a drag queen, actor, comedian, and author? Yes, there's more. She's actually a singer-songwriter, too — an autoharp, guitar, and drum-playing countryfolk musician who's already released a few albums since 2017. Her debut studio album Two Birds placed second in the Heatseekers Albums chart and sixteenth in the Americana/Folks Albums chart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her 2018 album One Stone was also a hit. It was a fusion of country, folk, and Top 40. When asked about the critics' response to it, <a href=#>Mattel told NPR</a>, "Oh — it's surreal. I hoped that it would sell, and I hoped that it would chart. But when the day came out when it was at No. 1 on the [iTunes] singer-songwriter chart, I was like, Oh my god. I don't write the music to sell it; I write it for my own human fulfillment." Surely, you can tell by her work that this is a drag artist who's always having fun in everything she does. That's why fans find her inspiring.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Little-Known Facts About RuPaul's Drag Race That Change Everything</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-trixie-mattel-39-s-boyfriend-david-silver>Who Is Trixie Mattel's Boyfriend, David Silver?</h2><p>Trixie Mattel has been dating David Silver since 2016. They may not be too public about their relationship but on Mattel's <a href=#>Netflix </a>documentary Trixie Mattel: Moving Parts, fans were given a glimpse of their private life. Silver is obviously a caring and supportive boyfriend to the entertainer. But he's definitely not just some stage boyfriend. Having been in the film industry for over 15 years now, Silver has worked as a crew for major Hollywood movies like Batman Begins and The Break-Up starring Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite having their relationship away from the limelight, Mattel still talks about Silver in public. She even credited him for her upcoming "Grown Up" tour. The drag queen said that she wanted to get material from the three years she's spent with her beau. Mattel has always taken inspiration from her romantic life. But this time, it's also her official transition to adulthood (entering 30s) that made her create this "show where we can make the audience feel like kids, but also address their adulthood fears."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>17 Queens In Rupaul's Drag Race Who Were Fake For The Cameras</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-david-silver-39-s-role-in-trixie-mattel-39-s-creative-pursuits>What Is David Silver's Role In Trixie Mattel's Creative Pursuits?</h2><p>David Silver is currently working as a producer. He also produced Mattel's Netflix documentary. "Originally, I don’t like to work with anybody that I have a relationship with," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mattel told World of Wonder</a>. "But my manager at the time and David both came to me separately and said, 'You should do a film about this section of your life because so many things are happening.'" The UNHhhh host also said that behind the scenes, filming the documentary was difficult because she wasn't fond of the camera watching everything inside her personal life. But Silver made it a bit easier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"David went to school with Nick [Zeig-Owens], who is a great filmmaker and is the perfect guy to just follow you on your shoulder and get all this," Mattel said. Offstage, Mattel is really protective of her privacy, hence the initial hesitation in making the docu-film. "That's like, on a set and you're filming ten other people. This is you in a cab with me, in a shower with me, backstage with me. Everywhere," Mattel explained when the interviewer asked about the difference between filming Making Parts and being in a reality show for long periods."</p><p>In the end, the Trixie Cosmetics founder realized why her boyfriend encouraged her to do the film. "I never once asked them to leave the room or stop filming. You got the best and worst of it. But there really were some moments where I’m watching it back, like, this is magical," she said.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Trixie Mattel Reacts To Queer Couple In 'The Princess Switch: Switched Again'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmq6uhqJ6ybrnArauepF2isrV5x56pZqSfo7S1tcyeZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSdmaaesW6%2FyKWtnqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
