Within that month, he became a Hollywood pariah, going through a <a href=#>divorce from his wife, Georgina Chapman</a>. In March 2020, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison for criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree. Since <a href=#>his conviction – which was overturned in April 2024</a> – more celebrities have also shared their experiences with the Miramax co-founder.</p><p>For instance, Gwyneth Paltrow told <strong><a href=#>Howard Stern</a></strong> that <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> </strong>had to <a href=#>protect her from Weinstein after a disturbing hotel encounter</a>. According to an accuser, the entertainment mogul would promise them acting careers and brag about "sleeping" with Paltrow, as well as <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a></strong> – who once said the former film producer was actually "nice" to her. At one point, even fans had serious suspicions about Lawrence's relationship with Weinstein.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_matt-damon-disastrous-experience-making-his-444-million-bourne-movie-ruined-the-franchise-for-him_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Matt Damon Gave His Interpretation On What Happened Between Harvey Weinstein And Gwyneth Paltrow">Matt Damon Gave His Interpretation On What Happened Between Harvey Weinstein And Gwyneth Paltrow</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Matt Damon heard from Ben Affleck before it went public about what took place between Harvey Weinstein and Gwyneth Paltrow.</p><h2 id=harvey-weinstein-allegedly-said-he-quot-slept-quot-with-jennifer-lawrence-before-her-first-oscar-win>Harvey Weinstein Allegedly Said He "Slept" With Jennifer Lawrence Before Her First Oscar Win</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/harvey-weinstein.jpg><p>In 2018, a Jane Doe sued Weinstein for allegedly pressuring her to perform oral sex on him. The woman recalled the <a href=#>ailing sex offender</a> saying: <strong>"Do you even want to be an actress? I slept with Jennifer Lawrence and look where she is; she has just won an Oscar."</strong> The actress worked with The Weinstein Company in 2012 for Silver Linings Playbook – the film that made her the second-youngest winner of the Oscar for Best Actress.</p><p>What's interesting is that Lawrence forgot to thank Weinstein during her acceptance speech at the 2013 Academy Awards ceremony. <strong>"I forgot to thank Harvey Weinstein, so that's the end of my career, but it's been amazing, it's been fun,"</strong> she joked – almost ominously – while talking to Extra before addressing the producer endearingly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Thank you, Harvey. I love you," Lawrence said after receiving her first Oscar. "You're still my little rascal!"</p><p>Weinstein kept reminding the Serena star of that incident, even after congratulating him on his newborn son while presenting at the 24th GLAAD Awards that year. "Harvey gave us just what we needed—another him," she said. "If he's anything like his dad, he's going to be relentless, passionate, and just about the best mentor an aspiring actor could ever hope for." He responded: <strong>"Thank you, Jen—but you can stop kissing up to me for forgetting to thank me at the Oscars."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the record, Lawrence managed to thank Weinstein onstage when she accepted her Golden Globe Award for the same role. But it's kind of eerie looking back at it now. <strong>"Harvey, thank you for killing whoever you had to kill to get me up here today,"</strong> she said at that time. Ronan Farrow, the leading journalist behind #MeToo, revealed that <strong>Weinstein hired men from Black Cube (an Israeli private investigation firm) to intimidate him while working on the story</strong>.</p><p>"Hiring the agency was only a part of Weinstein's larger effort to prevent the disclosure of the sexual-abuse claims," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Farrow wrote in his 2017 book, Catch and Kill</a>. He added that <strong>"in the preceding weeks, I'd begun to suspect that I was being followed. My building superintendent had told me that he'd seen men lurking outside. Sources had advised me to get a gun and move out of my apartment."</strong></p><p>Harvey Weinstein's net worth has dropped from $300 million to $25 million (as of June 2024) following his 2020 conviction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jennifer-lawrence-s-forgotten-feud-against-joan-rivers-and-kelly-osbourne-got-very-personal-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence's Forgotten Feud With Joan Rivers And Kelly Osbourne Got Very Personal">Jennifer Lawrence's Forgotten Feud With Joan Rivers And Kelly Osbourne Got Very Personal</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Lawrence shared surprisingly harsh words with Joan Rivers and Kelly Osbourne during their forgotten feud.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-said-harvey-weinstein-quot-had-only-ever-been-nice-quot-to-her>Jennifer Lawrence Said Harvey Weinstein "Had Only Ever Been Nice" To Her</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar45832942.jpg><p>In 2018, Weinstein's lawyers attempted to block lawsuits by name-dropping famous Hollywood women who used to support him. "<strong>Jennifer Lawrence, who told <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> she had known Weinstein since she was 20 years old and said 'he had only ever been nice to me,'</strong> and Meryl Streep, who stated publicly that Weinstein had always been respectful to her in their working relationship," the suit stated.</p><p>Lawrence quickly responded: "Harvey Weinstein and his company are continuing to do what they have always done, which is to take things out of context and use them for their own benefit. This is what predators do, and it must stop."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then clarified that she was never "victimized" by the former movie producer. "For the record, <strong>while</strong><strong>I was not victimized personally by Harvey Weinstein</strong>, <strong>I stand behind the women who have survived his terrible abuse </strong>and I applaud them in using all means necessary to bring him to justice whether through criminal or civil actions."</p><p>"Time's up," added the Don't Look Up alum. During her Vogue 73 Questions in 2022, <strong>Lawrence said the "most bizarre thing" she'd ever read about herself was "That I f**ked Harvey Weinstein."</strong> The actress had already been alluding to a rift between her and Weinstein, years before his scandal broke out. Here's a timeline of their relationship:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>They first worked together on Silver Linings Playbook when Lawrence was 22</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>Weinstein seemingly took offense at Lawrence forgetting to thank him during her Oscars acceptance speech</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>Lawrence called Weinstein an "idiot" for saying she was planning to take a 12-month acting break after a significant boost in her fortune</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p>Lawrence said Weinstein was a "brute" father figure to her.

After the American Hustle actress called her "c*nt" on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in March that year, the reality star fired back by saying Lawrence is the "type of chick" to sleep with Weinstein.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking to Heather McDonald on the Juicy Scoop podcast, Kent said of the Red Sparrow star: "'Well, here's the thing. Now any time you bring her up, like, I'm going to have nothing nice to say about her.<strong> I'm going say that she sucked everyone's d--ks to get to where she is."</strong></p><p>"I'm going to say that her hair sucks, her face is a little too pudgy like she needs to stop the drinking, you know?" <strong>When asked if she thought Lawrence had sexual relations with Weinstein, she answered: "Yeah, I think she's that type of chick."</strong></p><p>"My man is in the movie business. It is now said that she is not as valuable, and [Lawrence] has to have another actor or actress to, like, get the numbers up," Kent added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Vanderpump star also called out Lawrence for calling her a "c*nt." She said: "You're an A-list celebrity who makes more money than God, and you're like saying you support women and you're calling another woman the c-word that you've never laid eyes on in person, never had a conversation with me."</p><p>Kent continued: "I tried to not let it bug me, but it never feels good to be called that, on top of someone who is that big and grand and A-list and glamorous. It was kind of like, 'That kind of hurt my feelings a little bit.' <strong>I think we've come to the conclusion [Lawrence] sucks</strong>."</p><p>Speaking to Andy Cohen about Lala Kent's friendship with her Vanderpump Rules co-stars, Jennifer Lawrence said: "Lala's trying so hard to be nice and then she's like crying to her mom and then she's like a total b-tch … I'm like, 'B*tch you's a c*nt.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylmLCqlaOwprTAq62esV2ssqq60q2coqZdqMK0vMicoKito2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
