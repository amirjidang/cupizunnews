She struggled with <a href=#>unemployment and financial challenges</a> in the earlier days of her career, but her fortunes took a turn when she was cast as Bernadette Rostenkowski in <a href=#><strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong></a>.</p><p>Initially, the character was only meant for a brief appearance, but she ended up becoming a staple of the popular sitcom and consequently catapulting the actress to global acclaim. Despite this early uncertainty, Rauch’s career has continued to evolve <a href=#>since her time on Big Bang</a>.</p><p>Starting January 2013, Rauch has now embraced a lead role in the reboot of Night Court, an NBC sitcom that reimagines the beloved original series from the 1980s. Since its premiere, the show has earned a strongly positive reception, with the Jersey-born star being particularly lauded for her performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Moment-Fans-Noticed-Melissa-Rauchs-Voice-Change-On-The-Big-Bang-Theory.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Big Bang Theory Fans Are Totally Split On Whether They Like Bernadette, Here’s Why</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Why are The Big Bang Theory viewers so divided when it comes to Melissa Rauch's smart and funny character Bernadette?</span><p>Yet, for Rauch, she almost never had this kind of career in the first place, after a director reportedly dismissed her for a role upon seeing her hands.</p><h2 id=melissa-rauch-revealed-her-struggles-in-hollywood-which-included-her-39-hobbit-hands-39>Melissa Rauch Revealed Her Struggles In Hollywood, Which Included Her 'Hobbit Hands'</h2><p>Melissa Rauch shared her experiences during a January 2023 appearance on The View, where she was promoting her Night Court sequel. During the discussion, she recounted an instance when a commercial director criticized her hands during an audition, which resulted in her losing a potential job in a restaurant advertisement.</p><p>It was Sara Haines, one of The View co-hosts, who brought up the topic of enduring criticism in Hollywood, to which Rauch responded with a personal anecdote. She explained to the panel, “When I was first auditioning and going out for commercials, my hands really stood in the way. I sort of have Hobbit hands.... especially when I was living in New York, they were always chapped.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The incident that stood out to Rauch involved a nearly secured role in a commercial for Friday’s, where she was to be cast as a waitress.

In addition to this, she appeared in several films, including Delirious in 2006, and I Love You, Man in 2009.</p><p>Rauch’s television career was kickstarted by her performances in 12 Miles of Bad Road, an HBO series where she appeared in three episodes, and the sitcom Kath & Kim on NBC, where she had a recurring role across six episodes from 2008 to 2009.</p><p>It was in 2009 when Rauch began to gain wider recognition, landing the recurring role of Bernadette Rostenkowski on Big Bang.

Her journey didn’t stop there, though, as she expanded her horizons into the realms of writing and producing.</p><p>In her Night Court revival, Rauch not only stars as Judge Abby Stone, the daughter of characters from the original series, but she also takes on the role of co-producer alongside her husband, Winston Beigel. This project is the latest joint venture between the pair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beigel himself is involved in the entertainment industry as a director, writer, and producer.
