Learn how to dress for any rooftop bar in the big apple and feel confident.</p><h2 id=smart-casual---the-press-lounge>Smart Casual - The Press Lounge</h2><p><a href=#>If you want to plan a trip to a New York City </a>rooftop, the ideal is a smart casual dress code with exceptions like a wedding reception or a costume party. Although we can describe a broad range of fine clothing as "smart casual," the term is most commonly used to describe well-fitting, neat, and appropriate attire. Not entirely as relaxed in fit as business casual, but still suitable for professional settings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Choose <a href=#>collared shirts, button-ups, and blouses with unique fabric</a> embellishments for a chic, casual style. You can make any top look more formal by layering a jacket over it. While wearing bright hues is fine, too much of any one shade can make you look too laid-back. These tops look fantastic with various pants, including <a href=#>chinos</a>, <a href=#>silk pants,</a> and <a href=#>dress pants</a>. Both long and short skirts are acceptable; however, Pinstripe skirts are too business casual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can strike a chic yet casual balance by dressing in a sheath or <a href=#>collared shirt dress</a>. A <a href=#>jumpsuit </a>is a terrific opportunity to experiment with a new style; choose one with a waist belt for a more polished feel. To avoid seeming too casual or formal, steer clear of floor-length dresses, sneakers, and other ultra-casual footwear. Instead, opt for shoes like loafers, flats, or oxfords are great for a sophisticated casual outfit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The Press Lounge</a> is an excellent illustration of a New York City rooftop bar with a smart casual dress code and breathtaking views of Manhattan. The Press Lounge is a sophisticated establishment with a glass-walled design, seasonal drinks, an extensive wine list, small seasonal meals, and pleasant service. When it opened in 2010, it rapidly gained a reputation as one of Manhattan's finest rooftop lounges, and today it is ranked among the top 22 rooftops in the world. So wear your best smart casual attire and take advantage of this fantastic venue.</p><h2 id=casual-look---the-brass-monkey>Casual Look - The Brass Monkey</h2><p>Wearing whatever you choose is not considered "casual." What this actually means, though, is that you need to wear a clean set of clothes and shoes to avoid any problems. <a href=#>Jeans</a>, <a href=#>T-shirts</a>, and <a href=#>cardigans</a> are the usual fare of the casual wear variety. You may dress down a sophisticated outfit by adding a plain T-shirt; couple it with some daring slacks and <a href=#>heels</a>, and you'll be ready for anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Skirts and sandals are safe if you want to dress more femininely. Wearing flared pants and a printed top is another great way to express your inner 1970s supermodel. Show off your shoulders with a crop top and rock some statement jeans and killer heels for a change of pace.</p><p><a href=#>Wear a beautiful, flowing dress and bask in the sun</a> while the weather permits. Whether you choose bright prints or a linen blend, a <a href=#>charming dress </a>is always a good choice for a relaxed occasion. Depending on the event, you can dress this up or down with a few simple additions. Wear a cardigan over a lovely midi dress and shoes; tighten your waist with a wide belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A rooftop bar, which is more of a pub than a cocktail lounge, is the perfect place to show off your daring fashion sense by pairing it with a few complementary statement pieces. <a href=#>The Brass Monkey,</a> one of New York's most popular rooftop bars, is an example. It is open for business in an outside street cafe, one of their three interior bars, and the outdoor roof terrace, where you will be heading in your show-stopping casual outfit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Most Common NYC Spots For Celebrity Sightings</a></span></p><h2 id=formal-business-casual---the-skylark>Formal / Business Casual - The Skylark</h2><p>While <a href=#>most New York City rooftops need formal wear for particular events</a> like a New Year's party, some of the more costly and fashionable rooftop bars often have regular rules regarding the wardrobe of their guests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wearing formal clothing is reserved for the most upscale of social engagements. Dressing appropriately for the event and type of rooftop bar is essential for pulling off a formal look. You might be surprised to learn that there are a variety of formal occasions, each with its dress code. A ball gown may be appropriate for a fancy wedding but not a business meeting that calls for black tie attire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand,<a href=#> women's business casual attire is typically a collared or sleeveless blouse,</a> a dress or skirt no shorter than knee length, slacks, heels, dress boots, flats, and small jewelry and accessories. <a href=#>The Skylark </a>is one New York City rooftop bar that requires patrons to dress formally or in business casual attire. The Skylark is a year-round bar in the middle of Times Square, known for its classic drinks, modern decor, and breathtaking views.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lounge, located on the 30th level, has floor-to-ceiling windows and a large rooftop patio with spectacular views of Manhattan's most famous sites. Guests in the summertime move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas, mingling over exquisitely crafted cocktails and tasty small plates while they take in the stunning sunset views. So put on your finest formal or casual business gear and experience a true New York City masterpiece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsawwYynnJ6cXam8brfNqK5mmZKkwrV5w6ucrKuZo7Ruwc9mnaiqXZa7brHVnqWippdirrV506GcrJ1dl7K0wIyrpqiepKS9bq7Aq6pmoZ5iu6bDjLKmq6NdmLa1xY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
