The Tudors actor lost it and yelled uncontrollably at her.</p><p>He reportedly told her on the flight that they would be getting a divorce when they get back as she had been too annoying for him. Prior to the outburst, Jonathan Rhys Meyer was said to have ordered multiple drinks and had visited the restroom up to 15 times. He also had an altercation with a flight attendant earlier before lashing out at his wife. The situation got really bad that an off-duty pilot was reportedly asked to stay in the cabin in order to keep an eye on him and equally monitor the situation.</p><p>On arriving home, The Brink actress apologised on behalf of her husband on her Instagram handle and stated that they arrived home safely. She is indeed not doing badly as she has been standing as her husband’s support and pillar over the years.</p><p>The incident was not the first time her husband has been on the news as a result of his eccentric behaviors.
