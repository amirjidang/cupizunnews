He attended Indiana University where he studied journalism. He moved to the west coast where he became a reporter where he wrote about pop culture and celebrities for places like The Lost Angeles Times as well as Entertainment Weekly. Although he had a degree in journalism and had a passion for that, he also loved creative writing and worked a lot on screenplays on the side during his spare time.</p><h2 id=he-can-sing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Can Sing</span></h2><p>When coming up with the concept of Glee, <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> took a lot from his own personal life as he was in multiple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">choirs</a> during his schooling. When he was a teenager at Warren Central High School, not only did he sing in the school's choir, but he also was engaged in the theater department of the school. When he went to college, he continued to be involved with music as he worked toward his degree, and was a member of the Singing Hoosier vocal ensemble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-famous-face-purchased-his-first-script><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>A Famous Face Purchased His First Script</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ryan-murphy.jpg><p>While <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> was still working as a reporter and writing screenplays on the side, he managed to complete one called Why Can't I Be Audrey Hepburn. The script got the attention of none other than the famous <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>. Steven offered to buy the script, and it was Ryan's very first one which was a huge accomplishment for him, especially since he looked up to Steven Spielberg. Sadly, though, the script sat in pre-production for years, and nothing came of it, but he can say that Steven Spielberg was interested in his first script!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=named-an-influential-person><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Named An Influential Person</span></h2><p>Back in 2019, <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">named</a> one of Time's 100 Influential People. This was a huge honor for him to appear on the list as one of the most influential people, as he's extremely successful and a member of the LGBT community. Actress Jessica Lange wrote a piece about Ryan and why he deserved to be on the list, as she worked with him many times on the set of American Horror Story.</p><h2 id=he-has-his-own-production-company><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Has His Own Production Company</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ryan-murphy-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you have the brain of <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> and you have the ability to come up with as many shows as he does, you might need a little extra help when it comes to producing them. Because of this, Ryan decided to create his very own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">production company</a> called Ryan Murphy Productions. The company is home to plenty of our favorite Ryan Murphy hits such as American Horror Story, Glee, American Crime Story, as well as Scream Queens. His most recent deal with Netflix has also given him a heavy workload.</p><h2 id=he-has-a-huge-netflix-deal><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Has A Huge Netflix Deal</span></h2><p>Back in 2018, <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> signed a huge <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deal</a> with Netflix to produce several shows, movies, and documentaries for the streaming service. The deal is for several years and Netflix paid him $300 million. As soon as he signed the deal the streaming service already gave him the go-ahead to make four shows, three movies, and three documentaries. Two of his shows, The Politician and Hollywood didn't get as high rates as his other works have gotten, but Ryan is still producing more and more content for Netflix thanks to the deal he signed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-first-emmy-was-for-39-glee-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His First Emmy Was For 'Glee'</span></h2><p>All celebrities remember the very first big award that they've ever gotten in their career, and for <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> that was his very <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first Emmy award</a> for his show Glee.

According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, less than a year after launching, they hired 60% women directors and 90% met the women, minorities, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ requirements that he had set in place.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Intertwined: How Each Season Of American Horror Story Is Connected</a></span>There is also an educational Director Shadowing Program where directors on his shows must mentor women, BIPOC, and other minorities through an episode that they're producing from start to finish. Those who participate in the program will also be financially compensated for travel, lodging, and daycare if needed. In 2021a program for Production Assistants was also created, which follows the same idea of the shadowing directors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-a-husband-and-three-kids><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Has A Husband And Three Kids</span></h2><p>Even though <a href=#>Ryan Murphy</a> has a lot going on in his work life, he has quite a busy private life as well.
