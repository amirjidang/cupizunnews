Travis’ brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>, and sister-in-law, <strong>Kylie Kelce</strong>, also joined Swift at several games as the Kansas City Chiefs <a href=#>made their way to the 2024 Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>Swift and Travis <a href=#>quietly started dating last summer</a> after the athlete publicly revealed his crush on Swift. After attending a stop on her Eras Tour in July 2023, Travis made his move, and two months later, Swift began regularly cheering her boyfriend on from the stands.</p><p>Earlier this year, Ed <a href=#>weighed in on the pair’s longevity</a> when he was asked whether Travis had plans to sign a prenup in the event of an engagement.</p><p>“I think you get to a point. I don’t know that Taylor is out there trying to make money, trying to build this huge empire,” Ed said on Audacy’s 92.3 The Fan radio show in January. “I think she’s out there following her passion, doing what she knows and what she enjoys. People are just throwing money at her, you know what I mean?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Ed-Kelce-Claps-Back-at-Troll-Bethenny-Frankel-Over-Travis-Kelce-and-Taylor-Swift-Romance-Criticism-2.jpg><p>Ed also shared how Travis and Swift’s <a href=#>high-profile romance</a> has affected the Kelce family. “I don’t know if it’s crazy,” he continued. “Yes, he’s dating Taylor. Yeah, there’s eyes on you every place you go.”</p><p>Ed said more people approach him now, adding, “I’ll be [in] the grocery store, somebody will smile and say, ‘Hey!’ Come over and say [hi], and I have no idea who they are. That has certainly picked up and become more frequent by a long shot than the before-Taylor days.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite speculation about a potential proposal, a source recently told Us Weekly that <a href=#>the couple aren’t in any rush.</a></p><p>“Travis and Taylor have no plans on getting engaged this summer,” the insider said about the false rumors. “Things between them are going amazing, but they haven’t even been together for a year yet and still have so much to learn about each other.”</p><p>After Travis’ team beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime,<a href=#> he joined Swift on the international leg of her Eras Tour</a>. The twosome were photographed spending time together in Australia before <a href=#>Travis flew to Las Vegas</a> over the weekend.
