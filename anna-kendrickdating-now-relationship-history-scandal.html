"They were both single at the same time," a source Us Weekly.</p><p>"They're really into each other and make each other laugh — a lot. They're keeping their relationship private, but friends close to them know." The relationship was short-lived, ending in the middle of the same year. Not much is known about the coupling because both stars are incredibly private.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fun Facts About Anna Kendrick's Biggest Roles</a></span></p><p>"Anna has been dating Bill quietly for over a year," a source told People Magazine in January 2022. "They met years ago. She's hosted Saturday Night Live, and they've done a movie together, but they got together well after the movie. They are both very private people, and with the pandemic it was easy to keep it quiet. They're both hysterical, so they must keep each other laughing all of the time.

"I was dating a guy. He tickled me playfully, and I said, 'I know that's cute and that people do it, but I really don't like being tickled. It really makes me feel trapped and panicked. I know it's silly and funny for most people, but I really hate it, so could you please not?' He thought that it was really dumb that I had a problem with being tickled and did it anyway," she explained.</p><p>"I broke up with him. And I knew that in the retelling of that story, I would be some crazy girl," she continued. "You never want to be labeled 'the crazy girl'.... That he would tell his friends, 'Oh, she broke up with me, because I tickled her. What a psycho.' I just had to go, 'No, I broke up with you because I told you something was important to me, and you didn't respect that.' I knew that he wouldn't necessarily frame it that way in his mind, and I just had to be okay with that. Which sucks, because you want to be understood.

"A guy who finds it amusing to make you uncomfortable — which is more common than you'd think — is someone you want to avoid." Although comments she made years later suggested she was with someone who you would want to avoid.</p><p>This was revealed in her interview on the Armchair Expert podcast, and it really got her fans' attention because she revealed a lot about being in a toxic relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-was-the-toxic-ex-boyfriend-anna-kendrick-spoke-about>Who Was The Toxic Ex-Boyfriend Anna Kendrick Spoke About?</h2><p>Anna Kendrick is pretty secretive about her relationship history, but she has spoken out about one ex-boyfriend (she chose not to name names) and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how toxic their time together was</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Alice, Darling May Be Anna Kendrick's Most Personal Project</a></span></p><p>"I was with someone — this was somebody I lived with, for all intents and purposes my husband.
