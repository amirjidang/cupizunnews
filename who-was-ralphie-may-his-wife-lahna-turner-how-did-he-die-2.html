The youngest of his parent’s four children, he grew up alongside his siblings in&nbsp;Clarksville, Arkansas.</p><p>In a 2012 interview with&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Arkansas Times,&nbsp;</i>Ralphie May talked about&nbsp;growing up in Clarksville, Arkansas, saying that things were hard for them just as it was for many other people&nbsp;in the state. His florist mother he said, and his father, hated each other and by extension, took it out on Ralphie and his siblings.</p><p>Speaking in several interviews, May revealed that his grandmother helped look after him and his siblings while they were growing up. According to him, she kept them in a&nbsp;stature way above their means and also ensured that they were well cared for&nbsp;as far as clean clothes and shoes were concerned.</p><p>Growing up, he considered comedian Sam Kinison his idol and at the age of 17, he took part in a contest to open for the popular stand-up comedian and won.&nbsp;Following&nbsp;Kinison’s suggestion that&nbsp;May should move&nbsp;to&nbsp;Houston in order to hone his comedy talent, he (Ralphie May) enrolled in&nbsp;High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, and subsequently, relocated to Los Angeles&nbsp;to pursue his dream of becoming a force to be reckoned with&nbsp;in the entertainment industry after graduation.</p><p>In 2003, he was selected to take part in the first season of NBC’s&nbsp;<i>Last Comic Standing&nbsp;</i>and finished in the second position&nbsp;in the competition, behind&nbsp;Dat Phan. He later went from a second-place finish on the reality television show&nbsp;to television and club appearances, including ABC’s&nbsp;<i>The Wayne Brady Show</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i>.</p><p>In 2005, he featured on&nbsp;<i>The Big Black Comedy Show&nbsp;</i>along with Mo’Nique, Rodman, and Vince Morris, and was the only white comedian who performed at the show. That same year, Ralphie May&nbsp;released his debut&nbsp;comedy album,&nbsp;<i>Just Correct</i>. He went on to record&nbsp;four&nbsp;Comedy Central&nbsp;specials from 2006 to 2008 and later in 2012. Also in 2012, he&nbsp; performed at the “Gathering of the&nbsp;Juggalos&nbsp;”</p><p>The following year, he recorded a&nbsp;Netflix&nbsp;special,&nbsp;<i>Imperfectly Yours,&nbsp;</i>and followed it up in 2015 with&nbsp;<i>Unruly.&nbsp;</i>Two years later, May&nbsp;published his&nbsp;memoir,&nbsp;<i>This Might Get a Little Heavy.</i></p><p>He has featured in a number of other works such as&nbsp;For Da Love of Money,&nbsp;<i>Girth of a Nation,&nbsp;</i><i>Inside Amy Schumer,&nbsp;Unruly,&nbsp;The Best of Comics Unleashed With Byron Allen </i>and&nbsp;<i>Penn & Teller: Fool Us,&nbsp;</i>among others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-wife-%e2%80%93-lahna-turner></span><strong>His Wife – Lahna Turner</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The late comedian was married to&nbsp;fellow comedian Lahna Turner. They got married on&nbsp;July 3, 2005, and had two children – a daughter named&nbsp;April June May and a son, August James May.</p><p>The couple jointly started&nbsp;a podcast known as&nbsp;<i>Perfect 10&nbsp;</i>in 2013 and by October 2015, their marriage went so sour that they&nbsp;filed for&nbsp;divorce&nbsp;citing irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;At the time of Raphie May’s death, the divorce was not finalized.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-he-die></span><strong> How Did He Die?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ralphie May suffered obesity all through his life. At the age of 16, he was involved in a car accident which kept him at a place, causing his weight to increase to&nbsp;800 pounds (360&nbsp;kg). In 2004, he lost&nbsp;350 pounds (160&nbsp;kg) following his participation in&nbsp;VH1’s&nbsp;Celebrity Fit Club and gastric bypass surgery.</p><p>The year 2011 saw the comedian losing more weight, 40 pounds (18 kg) precisely after he got sick with&nbsp;viral pneumonia&nbsp;on a cruise in October. The next month, he again, contracted&nbsp;serious pneumonia on a cruise ship and this resulted to a&nbsp;pulmonary embolism as a&nbsp;blood clot&nbsp;from his leg blocked one of his arteries.</p><p>On&nbsp;October 6, 2017, Raphie May died. His&nbsp;body was reportedly found in the morning of the said date at a&nbsp;private residence in Las Vegas, where he was lodging at Harrah’s Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.&nbsp;The comedian had performed there the previous night after&nbsp;several shows which were scheduled to&nbsp;go through the end of the year at the venue were canceled in a bid to allow May recover from&nbsp;pneumonia which he had battled for many weeks. According to his&nbsp;publicist Stacey Pokluda, the cause of his death was&nbsp;cardiac arrest.</p><p>It was reported that hours before he passed on, May was slated to have a&nbsp;meet-and-greet session&nbsp;after his last performance at Harrah’s around midnight, but that was not possible as he showed signs of his worsening health condition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmqZqkoJ22pnnMmrBmoJmoeri1xZ5kpZmYo65uwNSrpZ6qXZ28uHnDoptmoJVisaqxjGtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
