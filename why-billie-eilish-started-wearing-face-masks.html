Some of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best Instagram posts feature amazing outfits</a> that the average pop star wouldn't dream of donning.</p><p>She may have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">swapped her trademark tracksuit for a tank recently</a>, but Billie still favors full-coverage clothing for the most part. As far as the face masks, though, what was up with that?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Fans Are Sticking Up For Billie Eilish</a></span></p><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Don't Bore Us</a> recapped, Billie's big on style. Like, literally. Her baggy clothes are a statement, and so were the face masks, as it turns out.</p><p>Billie has always said she likes to be covered up,&nbsp;Don't Bore Us quoted, and she enjoys having "layers." The same way she likes to hide behind her baggy clothing, she also prefers to sneak around with her face hidden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It used to be that Billie even wore balaclavas to hide her mug, noted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Somersetlive</a>.&nbsp;In an interview, she defended the style choice by saying she was "done" with her face that day, even though her mom wasn't a big fan of the balaclava and pressured her to ditch it.</p><p>Even more impactful was Billie's statement that "I never want the world to know everything about me," because that way, they can't have an opinion because they have no clue what's underneath.</p><p>At the same time, Eilish likes to be looked at, quotes&nbsp;Somersetlive, and dresses wildly to draw attention to herself. In that same breath, she calls her clothing a safety net, so apparently, it's both.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And TBH, Billie's face masks have clearly always been a fashion accessory. Odds are, you won't catch the singer wearing a standard-issue disposable face mask, even with the pandemic raging.</p><p>Instead, Billie matches her face coverings to her 'fits. In a recent IG post, she capped her look with a headscarf and mask, wearing a coverup that also resembled a blanket.</p><p>But&nbsp;over a year ago, Billie was kicking off the fashion face mask trend with this bedazzled beauty, which matched both her nails and her bling. She's worn Gucci and other fashion house-branded masks, too.</p><p>And last year, she put on a surgical mask to head onstage during a concert. Funnily enough, these days, that's no longer her style, even if she kicked off the movement well in advance of the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Fans Think Billie Eilish Dislikes Lana Del Rey</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7atuMieZJ6hnJ7AqXnSrZirrJWZerixwKugp59dm66ksYymmKyjo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
