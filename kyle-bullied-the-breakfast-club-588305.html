Biggie had a lisp.”</p><p>“I feel like the reason Mike Tyson could whoop so much a** is cause he had a lisp,” laughed Kyle. “He probably got bullied as a kid.”</p><p>Kyle continued to discuss some of the taunts he was on the receiving end of, many of them pertaining to his signature crooked smile. “People called me sharktooth, Dracula,” he explained. “I got made fun of so much cause I couldn’t afford braces.” However, what helped him get through the teasing was J. Cole’s own track “Crooked Smile.”</p><p>Regardless of the taunts, Kyle has made quite a name for himself. He was a member of the 2017 XXL Freshman Class, and he just released his debut album,&nbsp;Light Of Mine, earlier this month. It features appearances from <a href=#>Kehlani</a>, 2 Chainz and Alessia Cara.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6DGrbGMm6ylpJmasW7Ax55km6qVlrinrdKtZJykpZd6doSXbGduZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
