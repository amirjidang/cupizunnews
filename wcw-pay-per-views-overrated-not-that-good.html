While <strong><a href=#>WCW</a></strong> didn't have many PPVs in its early days, the scenario changed after the introduction of Monday Night Nitro. The quantity increased with pay-per-views every month, but the quality certainly started to wane, especially after 1998.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 WCW Gimmick Changes That Worked (And 5 That Failed Miserably)</a></span></p><p>Besides Starrcade, The Great American Bash, Bash at the Beach, and Halloween Havoc were some significant PPVs of the company. While some WCW pay-per-views were outstanding and produced some greatest moments in wrestling history, some of them were overhyped, and they failed to live up to expectations.</p><h2 id=mayhem-2000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mayhem (2000)</span></h2><p>Mayhem, the second-to-last WCW pay-per-view of 2000, was truly mayhem, unlike the previous year, even though there were some good matches on paper. WCW's habit of booking too many matches in one pay-per-view was a primary reason why it fell flat.</p><p>There were some big names, but none of their matches stood out. The supposed dream match between Goldberg and Lex Luger was a disaster. Several matches were booked with little storyline build-up, which was common in WCW's final days. While The Insiders won the WCW <a href=#>Tag Team Titles </a>and Scott Steiner won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, the show was ordinary overall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=new-blood-rising-2000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>New Blood Rising ( 2000)</span></h2><p>New Blood Rising was held only once, but the solo edition wasn't as good as it sounded. It was just Vince Russo's another attempt to reboot things.</p><p>With 11 matches on the card, the show was too stacked. But ridiculous stipulations in a single PPV made the show terrible. Gold Record Ladder Match, Strap match, Forklift match, and Canadian Rules match were some stipulations added in the same show.</p><h2 id=road-wild-1998><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Road Wild (1998)</span></h2><p>1998 was certainly the biggest year for WCW, but Road Wild was a PPV that failed to deliver. With the guest performance of comedian Jay Leno, the show was supposed to be great, but it didn't reach the expectations of most fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 WCW Matches That Tried To Be Epic But Failed</a></span></p><p>Expected good matches between Stevie Ray and Chavo Guerrero were awful, while Goldberg won a battle royal match in less than eight minutes by dominating nWo members. Jay Leno was sloppy in the ring as a performer in the main event, where he and DDP beat WCW's biggest star Hollywood Hogan and Eric Bischoff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=uncensored-1996><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Uncensored (1996)</span></h2><p>1996 was a year that gave momentum to WCW, but Uncensored wasn't a good show to remember, even though it featured some big names like Randy Savage, <a href=#>Ric Flair</a>, and Hulk Hogan. Only one title match took place in the whole show, making it not a worthy show for PPV.</p><p>The WCW United States Championship match between Eddie Guerrero and Konnan was good, but the rest of the matches were ordinary, including the heavily advertised Doomsday Cage match in the main event.</p><h2 id=starrcade-1999><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Starrcade ( 1999)</span></h2><p>Being the biggest show of the year, Starrcade was huge, but the 1999 edition of the PPV also showed why WCW was dying. Though it was the biggest event of the year and consisted of 13 matches, none of the matches lasted more than 15 minutes.</p><p>Again, Vince Russo's habit of adding random stipulations was shown here, as the show had a Bunkhouse Brawl match, Crowbar on a Pole match, and even a Powerbomb match between Sid Vicious and Kevin Nash. The main event was disastrous not only for the bizarre ending but also for Goldberg's infamous botched kick that ended <a href=#>Bret Hart's wrestling career</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=souled-out-1998><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Souled Out (1998)</span></h2><p>Souled Out consisted of several dream matches. Matches between Kevin Nash and The Giant, Bret Hart and Ric Flair & Lex Luger, and Randy Savage garnered attention from fans, but WCW's bad booking failed to deliver. Except for the bout between Bret Hart and Ric Flair, the rest of the matches were lackluster.</p><p>Kevin Nash botched the Jackknife Powerbomb because he failed to pick up The Giant, and the match was terrible, overall. The main event was too short. Lex Luger submitted Randy Savage within seven minutes.</p><h2 id=hog-wild-1996><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Hog Wild (1996)</span></h2><p>All eyes were on Hog Wild PPV in 1996 because it was the first show after nWo was formed. But somehow it didn't produce a solid show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Worst WCW Title Matches, According To Cagematch.net</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The undercard matches were amazing. The WCW Cruiserweight match between Rey Mysterio and The Ultimate Dragon stood out, while the match between Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit was probably the best match of the night. <a href=#>Hollywood Hogan</a> beat The Giant, but it was an ordinary and slow match. Hogan's first post-nWo pay-per-view match should have been extraordinary.</p><h2 id=uncensored-1998><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Uncensored (1998)</span></h2><p>Like the 1996 edition of Uncensored, the 1998 edition of the PPV wasn't a great show to remember, although it had two legendary names in the main event. Except for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship match and the WCW United States Championship match, the rest of the matches were substandard.</p><p>The main event featured two aged wrestlers and arch-rivals, Hulk Hogan and<a href=#> Randy Savage</a>, showing WCW's over-reliance on big names from the past. Moreover, the highly-anticipated steel cage match ended in a draw after interferences from The Discipline and Sting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bash-at-the-beach-2000><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bash At The Beach (2000)</span></h2><p>Bash at the Beach was certainly one of the biggest PPVs of WCW, but the 2000 edition wasn't a good one to be remembered, especially for an infamous controversy. The show was probably the last nail in the coffin for WCW because it saw the departure of their biggest name, <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>, that too in an ugly manner.</p><p>Vince Russo's mismanagement was shown in that event, as Hogan publicly quit the company while slamming Russo. There was not a notable good match in that event. While Booker T and Jeff Jarrett gave a decent performance, the fans already lost interest by then after the latter's involvement in the controversy of Hogan.</p><h2 id=starrcade-1997><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Starrcade (1997)</span></h2><p>Starrcade 1997 was the highest-grossing pay-per-view in WCW history, but the quality of the show didn't match its purchase number. Sting, who had all the momentum with the crow gimmick, faced Hollywood Hogan in the main event, but the match had a horrible finish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Hogan's win, the match restarted when Bret Hart claimed the referee didn't do a fair count. At last, Sting pinned Hogan to win the belt, making it look like they had a rematch. The undercard matches were average too, other than the WCW <a href=#>Cruiserweight Championship</a> match between Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenmMRuvMCyZKmdomLDqrHWrGSorpWnv6LAxJ1kp6ekYsGprdNmnqinlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
