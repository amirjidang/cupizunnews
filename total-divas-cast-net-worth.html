Network to showcase the dramas that take place behind the scenes, granting fans better access to that world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Current WWE Superstars With The Highest Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While many of the cast changes each year, there are some originals still on the show, with one athlete having appeared on every season. So, with a new series to celebrate, let's take a look at the cast of Total Divas, ranking them in terms of their net worths.</p><h2 id=sonya-deville-net-worth-100-000--1-million>Sonya Deville (Net Worth: $100,000-$1 Million)</h2><p>As one of WWE's newest talents, Sonya Deville's net worth isn't quite as high as other cast members on the show, coming in between<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $100,000-$1 million</a>, however, as her value continues to grow that is something that will increase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Deville has been added to the cast of Total Divas for this season, with the show set to explore the fact she is one of the first openly gay wrestlers in WWE history, which is going to provide plenty of stories on the show.</p><p>Within the ring, Deville is also showing plenty of promise with her MMA background she appears to be a star rising quickly rising in the ranks and will no doubt grow her net worth as her career continues.</p><h2 id=nia-jax-net-worth-0-3-million>Nia Jax (Net Worth: $0.3 Million)</h2><p>While she is currently out of action from inside the ring with an injury, Nia Jax will be on the television screen via Total Divas, where she is once again a cast member as the cameras follow her incident with Becky Lynch.</p><p>This season will watch Nia Jax's run as Women's Champion, her feud with Ronda Rousey and accidentally injuring Becky Lynch, in what should be a very interesting story throughout the season.</p><p>Nia Jax has a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$0.3 million</a>, which is something that you can guarantee will be rising as she has a huge career ahead of her in WWE, where she is expected to be a top talent when she returns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=naomi-net-worth-0-5-million>Naomi (Net Worth: $0.5 Million)</h2><p>Naomi has an estimated net worth of around<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $0.5</a> million, which comes from a lengthy spell working for WWE where she is a former SmackDown Live Women's Champion, as well as her role on Total Divas.</p><p>Naomi has played a major role in the success of the show over the years, with her journey with fellow WWE Superstar husband, Jimmy Uso being well documented throughout the show.</p><p>Much like Nia Jax, Naomi is actually out of action from WWE right now, although it is unknown as to why that is, with Naomi stating on social media that she will be back when she is ready.</p><h2 id=carmella-net-worth-100-000--1-million>Carmella (Net Worth: $100,000-$1 Million)</h2><p>Carmella is set to be one of the most focused women on the show this year as Total Divas explores her new relationship with WWE commentator, Corey Graves which caused plenty of controversies last year due to Graves allegedly still being in another relationship at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of that drama will be explored and truths will be revealed on the show as Carmella makes her second appearance on the reality program, continuing to be one of the most popular cast members.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Highest UFC Pay Days In History&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>While Carmella is only estimated to having a net worth between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100,000 to $1 million</a>, it is very likely that it is closer to the million mark, considering all of her accomplishments already in the business.</p><h2 id=eva-marie-net-worth-2-5-million>Eva Marie (Net Worth: $2.5 Million)</h2><p>Eva Marie is actually no longer even employed by WWE, and therefore hasn't been part of Total Divas for quite some time, however, she was an original cast member and she did get her start on this show.</p><p>Marie appeared on the reality program before she even stepped foot inside the ring, helping her grow her impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.5 million</a> net worth and putting herself on the map in a major way.</p><p>While she was never a highly skilled wrestler, Eva has had a very successful career outside of wrestling, mainly using the Total Divas show as a springboard to a fantastic career in modelling and fitness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paige-net-worth-3-6-million>Paige (Net Worth: $3.6 Million)</h2><p>While she isn't actually on the show this year, Paige has been one of the most important cast members in Total Divas history, with her very public highs and lows all being discussed on the show.</p><p>Paige has been a fan favorite on Total Divas and she will no doubt make the occasional appearance this season, but with her WWE career winding down, it is unknown if she will make a return to the full-time cast in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The Rock: 10 Crazy Expensive Things Dwayne Johnson Has Purchased</a></span></p><p>Despite the fact she has been forced to retire from in-ring competition, wrestling has helped her grow a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.6 million</a> already, and with her new cosmetics company, Paige is only going to continue to grow.</p><h2 id=natalya-net-worth-5-million>Natalya (Net Worth: $5 Million)</h2><p>The experienced WWE Superstar has a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million&nbsp;</a>and it is no surprise she has built up that much money, having been a loyal servant to WWE, being with the company longer than any other female wrestler on the roster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Natalya has also been incredibly loyal to the Total Divas brand as well, having been an original cast member, Nattie is now the only WWE Superstar to have been a featured cast member on every single show.</p><p>Once again Natalya will be part of the newest season of the show, and it is likely she will now always be part of the brand in some way.</p><h2 id=nikki-bella-net-worth-6-million>Nikki Bella (Net Worth: $6 Million)</h2><p>The popular Bella twin has a net worth of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $6 million</a> which she has earned through a variety of ways, mainly competing in the ring, but also her work on Total Divas, and Total Bellas, as well as her run on Dancing With The Stars.</p><p>However, even though the Bella Twins have been the main featured athletes on the reality show, this new season is the first that will not feature either of them, with the Bella's only making a few cameo appearances.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED<a href=#>: The 10 Richest Wrestlers In The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, for those wanting to keep updated on the goings-on of the Bella family, the opportunity will come as Total Bellas isn't going anywhere, and the twins remain hands-on as producers on Total Divas.</p><h2 id=brie-bella-net-worth-7-million>Brie Bella (Net Worth: $7 Million)</h2><p>Brie has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated </a>net worth of $7 million, which is surprisingly higher than her twin sister, despite the fact that they have spent their entire careers working together on all their projects.</p><p>As previously mentioned, Brie Bella isn't a featured cast member on the new season but she will be appearing from time to time and will still be a featured member of Total Bellas in the future.</p><p>Brie's in-ring career has also come to an end, but she is still incredibly busy building the Birdiebee brand with the clothing range as well as the Bella Twins YouTube channel, continuing to build her personal brand.</p><h2 id=ronda-rousey-net-worth-12-million>Ronda Rousey (Net Worth: $12 Million)</h2><p>When Ronda Rousey was dominating the world of MMA inside the octagon, very few people would have expected to see the 'baddest woman on the planet' end up on a reality show called Total Divas, yet here we are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rousey is the big name for the new season where the show will go through her journey as a WWE Superstar as she is part of the first-ever women's WrestleMania main event, providing fans with a greater insight into what she is like behind the scenes.</p><p>With a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$12 million</a>, Ronda Rousey is the richest member of the Total Divas cast in the history of the show, which isn't a major surprise considering how much star power the UFC legend has.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> The 8 Richest WWE Wrestlers Outside Of America&nbsp;</a></span></p><p class=postsid
