The 50-year-old actress is reportedly stalling her divorce from Ashton Kutcher because she is furious her 33-year-old ex-hubby of six years has moved on and is dating Mila Kunis, RadarOnline.com reports.
“Demi has instructed her attorneys to delay negotiations as much as possible,” a source says. “The main issue they have been fighting over has been the division of assets and the monetary settlement, but it’s now gotten to the point where Ashton is willing to cave in to all of Demi’s demands just to reach a settlement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Moore’s behavior also seems to be causing a rift between her and her three daughters, who were supposedly close to Kutcher throughout the marriage but resentful towards their mother.</p><p>“As far as the girls, and Ashton, are concerned everyone needs to move on with their lives and this whole fiasco has been going on for way too long,” the source adds.”However, Demi sees things differently and she can not forgive Ashton for moving on so quickly to Mila and flaunting their relationship publicly. It’s a classic case of a woman scorned.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5myrrWMpqaoqpViv6a8zqurnpycrnqlscuasKKml2KxqsLOq5qeZZGotbW7zWairqyTnbKzeZBraWlxaGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
