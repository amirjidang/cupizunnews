Snoop Dogg made appearances during November’s Mike Tyson-Roy Jones Jr. match and again in April for the fight between Jake Paul and Ben Askren.

Although the exact amount is unclear, Trump reportedly bragged about the amount being 'obscene.' Additionally, the former president said that Triller is providing him with a G-5 jet to fly him back and forth. It’s unclear what Triller is paying Don Jr., who will be by his father’s side in the commentary booth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Triller Fight Club pay-per-view begins at 7:00 p.m. ET and is priced at $49.99.
