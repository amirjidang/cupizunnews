Before she could be brought to the hospital, she was dead.</p><p>The true story of a woman being shot dead at her home while her last breaths were captured on a Facebook live is revealed through an investigation.</p><p>Rannita Williams, a 27-year-old mother of three from Shreveport, Louisiana, was murdered. Her death was unexpected, as she appeared to be moving on from her open relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-johnathan-robinson-today></span>Where is Johnathan Robinson today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Johnathan had shown regret for his actions and intended to confess to Rannita’s murder. However, because the prosecution intended to seek the death penalty at the moment, a guilty plea was not an option.</p><p>The death penalty was no longer requested after discussing with Rannita’s family regarding the plea arrangement. Johnathan pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in January 2019 and was sentenced to prison with no chance of release. For shooting at police officers, an additional 100 years had to be served.</p><figure></figure><p>After his sentencing, Johnathan spoke with Rannita’s mother, Anita. Johnathan apologizes to her with a tear in his eyes. He had previously written her an apology letter from prison. Johnathan also expressed regret for shooting at the officers.</p><p>In an emotional experience, Anita&nbsp;accepted his apologies&nbsp;and expressed her forgiveness to him. She remarked that she had never believed in murder and was happy that justice had finally been done.</p><p>Currently, Johnathan is serving his sentence in a Louisiana penitentiary facility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqRo7uqwMBmrqKknJ6urr%2BMpqyrnJWnsqV5wbJknrBdl7y6stGinKecXZ%2B8qbrArZ%2Bapl2nvKO1zaymp2WYmr%2BmecisZJqmXaq9pa3TnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
