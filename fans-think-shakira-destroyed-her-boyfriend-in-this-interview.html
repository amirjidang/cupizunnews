This comes on the back of reports that the professional soccer star was unfaithful to Shakira, and that he has already been living in a separate house in Barcelona, Spain.</p><p>The pair have been in a relationship for more than a decade now, although they appear to have made a conscious decision <a href=#>not to get married</a>. Together, Shakira and Piqué have two children. The rumors of an impending split are not verified, but some people will argue that they saw trouble brewing in paradise a while ago.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Shakira's Relationship With Her 'Husband', Gerard Piqué</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In late 2020, the couple sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes. Some of the sound bites from the exchange left fans empathizing with Piqué, who they felt was being 'emotionally wrecked' by his partner and the things that she was saying.</p><h2 id=who-is-shakira-39-s-boyfriend-gerard-piqu-eacute-and-what-does-he-do>Who Is Shakira's Boyfriend, Gerard Piqué, And What Does He Do?</h2><p>Gerard Piqué is a soccer player who plies his trade for Spanish club FC Barcelona, as well as the Spanish national team. At the age of 35, he is exactly 10 years younger than Shakira, with whom he actually shares a birthday.</p><p>Apart from being a ball player, Piqué is also an entrepreneur, who according to his Instagram bio, is the President and Founder of a company called Kosmos. According to their official website, the outfit invests in 'impactful' ventures in the fields of sports and entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Piqué's grandfather was a director at FC Barcelona, and the player himself once revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he harbors the dream of one day becoming club president</a> when he eventually hangs up his boots.</p><p>Shakira and Piqué met in 2010, when he was representing his country at that year's World Cup finals in South Africa, and she was contracted to write, perform and promote the tournament's official anthem.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Timeline Of The 20 Best And Worst Moments Of Shakira's Career</a></span></p><p>They started dating soon after, and officially went public as a couple the following year.</p><h2 id=what-did-shakira-say-about-gerard-piqu-eacute-in-the-39-60-minutes-39-interview>What Did Shakira Say About Gerard Piqué In The '60 Minutes' Interview?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A 60 Minutes interview usually consists of three 15-minute segments, with breaks in between. As such, any sit-down with the CBS show will usually be extensive and in-depth. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shakira and Gerard Piqué one</a> was no different, as host Bill Whitaker got them to discuss their personal lives and their respective careers, among other topics.</p><p>The first thing that fans picked on from the interview was when Whitaker asked them why, despite living life practically as a married couple, they still had never gotten officially married. "We're not married," Shakira quickly pointed out, even before the host had finished asking his question.</p><p>"To tell you the truth, marriage scares the sh*t out of me," she continued. "I don't want him to see me as the wife. I'd rather him see me as his lover, his girlfriend. I wanna keep him on his toes. I want him to think that anything's possible, depending on behavior."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Things Fans Don't Know About Shakira's Private Life</a></span></p><p>All the while, Piqué kept smiling and chuckling awkwardly, although that could also be explained by his introverted personality, as opposed to what Shakira was actually saying.</p><h2 id=are-shakira-and-gerard-piqu-eacute-actually-splitting-up>Are Shakira And Gerard Piqué Actually Splitting Up?</h2><p>After about two years together, Shakira and Gerard Piqué welcomed their first son, Milan in January 2013. Their second-born - also a boy - was born another two years later in January 2015. They named him Sasha.</p><p>The celebrity couple have some slightly <a href=#>unorthodox methods of parenting</a> their two sons, in an attempt to 'keep things as normal as possible' in their household. This includes an abstinence from playing Shakira's music at home, as a way to help the kids disassociate their mother from her fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I try to avoid playing my own music in my house, in my environment," Shakira once said of the decision. "I try to give them as much normalcy as I can. They can’t escape the reality that I’m a public person as well as their dad, but we try to live as very simple people."</p><p>When the stories first broke of Piqué's alleged infidelity, it was reported that he had been cheating on Shakira with the mother of one of his young teammates. This version of events is currently yet to be proven, as is the suggestion - as strong as it might be - that the two lovers are finally calling time on their relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>17 Candid Shakira Photos Pique Wants To Delete</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsGptc2kZKygkaC2s62MnZysrKKkxqawjKGcq2WSpManvsiepZ1lmaN6tbTIrGSipqSav7e1xLBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
