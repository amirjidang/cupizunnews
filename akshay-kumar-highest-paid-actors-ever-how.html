Soon he realized that he had the body to try out the career of modeling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After some setbacks and rejections, he finally met the director Pramod Chakravarthy. This fateful encounter led to his debut in the Bollywood industry. He got the lead role in the 1992 movie <i>'Deedar.'</i></p><p>Kumar, however, got his big break with his second Bollywood movie, <i>'Khiladi,'</i> also released the same year. What happened after this is history. This Indian actor hailing from a humble background, started making lots of money with every movie he starred in. It is estimated that he has starred in at least 150 films to date.</p><p>Akshay Kumar usually has the target of making and starring in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4 movies every year</a>. That's an insane amount of income. However, this Bollywood Star has a distinct charm on screen, making him one of the <a href=#>highest-paid actors ever</a>.</p><h2 id=akshay-kumar-s-brilliant-acting-career>Akshay Kumar's Brilliant Acting Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Akshay Kumar had his big break with <i>'Khiladi'</i> in 1992, he made one blockbuster movie after another. He starred in films like <i>'Mohra'</i> in 1994 and Phir Hera Pheri in 2006; both proved to be significant chartbusters. Some of his recent Bollywood movies, which were super hits according to the Indian Box Office standards, are <i>'Good Newwz,'</i><i>'2.0'</i>, and <i>'Mission Mangal.'</i></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Akshay Kumar Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Mission Mangal made about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$65 million</a> at the box office and became one of the most popular movies by Akshay Kumar.

Akshay Kumar has signed deals for about $13 million each for upcoming movies' <i>Bachhan Pandey'</i> and <i>'Bell Bottom.'</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the <a href=#>Bollywood industry's gross income</a> is lower than that of Hollywood, the industry tries to make up for the money by selling satellite rights to TV channels. Even when Kumar does not earn well in the movie theaters, he remains hopeful that his name and fame will ultimately make him what he deserves when TV channels screen his movies. Kumar has been known to have rejected some offers from Hollywood because of his busy schedule.</p><h2 id=income-from-endorsements>Income From Endorsements</h2><p>Akshay Kumar's source of income is not solely based on the films. He earns a lot from the different advertisements he acts in and the various brands he endorses.

In India, the movie industry is a vital part of people's lives as they typically grow up in a culture that is inspired and driven by movies.</p><p>Bollywood and other regional movie industries in India also produce more movies than most other film industries worldwide. However, the current trend is that of online streaming. With the ongoing pandemic, going to movie theatres has become even more non-feasible. These online websites are doing well in India because Indian has the perfect demographic for it - about 1.35 billion people in the country are under the age of 35.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Akshay Kumar is known to have signed a new contract to act in a show that shall stream <a href=#>online on Amazon Prime Video</a>.
