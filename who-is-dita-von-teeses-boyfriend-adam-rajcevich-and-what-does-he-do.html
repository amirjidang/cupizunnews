What I learned from my last engagements and marriage is that the most romantic part is being engaged and telling someone you want to be with them for the rest of your life.”</p><p>Further explaining her reason, she added, “So I thought about being perpetually engaged. I’m not engaged yet. But Adam and I have talked about it, not having a big wedding and just a long engagement.
