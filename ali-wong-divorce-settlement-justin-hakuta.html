It was an instant hit with fans, with her witty takes on pregnancy, feminism, and relationships resonating with the millions who watched it. She followed up the special with another hit, Hard Knock Wife, where the comedian appeared pregnant again.

Her act emphasized the importance of working through the chaos in our relationships. But looking deeper into her latest special, Don Wong, the warning signs of trouble between the couple seems obvious now. Still, many fans were shocked to hear of Ali and Justin's separation in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-ali-wong-predict-her-divorce-in-her-latest-comedy-special>Did Ali Wong Predict Her Divorce In Her Latest Comedy Special?</h2><p>Ali walked into Don Wong with an entirely different lease on life. Not only is she a certified comedy superstar, but she's also a mother and a wife. During the special, she admits she never thought she'd have success in her career, marriage, or as a mother. Now that she's attained success in all three, she explains that while she does "have it all," it's not all it's cracked up to be.</p><p>A large chunk of her hour is dedicated to exploring her newest craving - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wanting to cheat on her husband</a>.</p><p>She even says that while she hasn't yet, it's not due to a lack of trying. She just hadn't found any worthy men to cheat on him with. She thanks her new-found celebrity and success for the ever-present thoughts of other men.</p><p>Ali handles the topic with jest, but upon re-watching the special now, it's hard not to hear her words as warning signs about the couple's future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the end of the special, Ali sheepishly insists she's in a good place in her marriage. It quelled the public fears, however, with nearly everyone accepting her jokes as jokes. It wasn't the first time the comedian had poked fun at her marriage, either. She even <a href=#>admitted that the couple started going to couples counseling</a>.</p><p>Ali's special, littered with hints about the demise of her marriage, is also a profoundly motivational and cathartic piece of art. Her material was clever, poignant, and incredibly encouraging to women.</p><p>Recognizing one's wants and needs and vocalizing them is a valued skill needed at all points of life. Taylor Tomlinson, one of the best working comedians today, <a href=#>has attributed Ali's comedy as a massive inspiration to her own</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are 'Tuca & Bertie' Stars Tiffany Haddish And Ali Wong Best Friends In Real Life?</a></span></p><p>There's far more than just insight into the state of her marriage to be taken from Don Wong.</p><p>It's also a direct commentary on how differently we expect men to act and our constant acceptance of those actions. She closes her special out by saying regardless of how much money, success, fame, respect, or power women earn, they're never allowed to misbehave. "But that's all I want to do," the comedian pleads, almost as if she's asking the audience to come along with her for the ride.</p><h2 id=who-is-ali-wong-s-ex-husband>Who Is Ali Wong's Ex-Husband?</h2><p>Ali has shared a lot about her ex-husband Justin Hakuta. The two met at a mutual friend's wedding reception in 2010 and hit it off immediately. Justin attended Carnegie Mellon University and Harvard Business School before working his way through the corporate entrepreneurship world.</p><p>Most recently, he was the Vice President at GoodRx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ali claimed that she felt Justin was far out of her league during her first special. Realizing this, she devised a plan to "trap" the entrepreneur. She waited until their fifth date to even kiss him to ensure he was always wanting more of the comedian.</p><p>Little did Ali know, Justin was just as smitten with her. They married in 2014 and welcomed their first daughter the following year. âââââââ</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-did-ali-wong-have-to-pay-justin-hakuta-after-their-divorce>How Much Did Ali Wong Have To Pay Justin Hakuta After Their Divorce?</h2><p>The couple announced their divorce on April 14, 2022. They were married for eight years. Ali has spoken previously about signing a prenup before marrying Justin, joking that his family had to force the comedian to sign it. But the comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praised the document following her divorce proceedings</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are The Weirdest Celebrity Prenups</a></span></p><p>The prenup ensured the division of the couple's assets thoroughly, meaning that Ali would get nothing nor give anything to her husband in the divorce. She famously joked in her 2018 comedy special that her husband would have to go back to drinking flat water and bidet-less toilets if they were ever to split, with Ali being the clear breadwinner of the family.</p><p>Even with the divorce happening in California, a state that favors spousal support in divorce hearings, the iron-clad prenup worked in Ali's favor. Her ex-husband saw and continues to see little, if any, money from the comedian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpaFdrLyvs4ydoK%2Bnopiybr%2FEraulnZ2au7V5ya6qraGeYrWit9StmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
