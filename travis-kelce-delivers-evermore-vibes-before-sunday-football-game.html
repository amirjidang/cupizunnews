The NFL tight end, ever the fashion star, opted for a cozy, autumnal look for his game day ‘fit. Kelce sported a cozy green-and-yellow, flannel-inspired corduroy jacket with a fuzzy collar. He completed his look with beige trousers, white sneakers and a green beanie atop his head.</p><p class=p1>The colors of Kelce’s outfit, not to mention the beanie’s aesthetic, seemingly match the vibe of <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>’s <i>Evermore </i>album. Sunday also marks one day before<a href=#> <i>Evermore</i></a>’s third anniversary. Swift, 33, dropped the record in the middle of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic — on December 11. (Swift has been dating Kelce since this summer.)</p><p class=p1>While Kelce has not confirmed his style goals for his pregame ensemble, he’s been known to dress to impress off the NFL gridiron.</p><p class=p1>“Our game days are 16, 17 weeks, now 18 weeks out of the year. So it’s like we get, almost, anticipation for those big-time moments. It’s almost like it’s a red carpet every single week,” Kelce told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Complex </i></a>in September 2021. “I know in Kansas City, we have to be business casual [in] slacks. You can’t go full jeans and a T-shirt on an away game. Like, you have to actually dress business casual.”</p><p class=p1>Kelce’s style is one that is entirely his own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/travis-kelces-sunday-game-day-outfit-delivers-clear-evermore-vibes-if-you-ask-us-02.jpg><p class=p1>“Travis has a clear vision for his personal aesthetic and definitely styles himself,” his stylist <strong>Danielle Salzedo</strong> <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>last month</a>. “I know what he likes, and I find him options with brands we know are his vibe — while also looking for new ones yet to be discovered.”</p><p class=p2>Salzedo continued: “He plays a lot with monochromatic sets as well as oversized [looks]. He doesn’t shy away from mixing prints in unexpected ways.”</p><p class=p1>Sunday’s outfit referencing <i>Evermore </i>would not be the first time that Kelce seemed to emulate one of Swift’s musical eras. Ahead of their first public date in September, he <a href=#>wore a KidSuper two-piece</a> in baby blue that perfectly complemented the main colors of the cover for <i>1989. </i>In October, he arrived at a Chiefs game in <a href=#>brown, velvet pants that seemed to pay homage</a> to the 12-time Grammy winner’s curtains in her “Midnights Mayhem With Me” social media videos.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Travis’ mom, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>, approved of the bronze pants,<a href=#> telling <i>Us </i>in November</a> that they looked “nice.”</p><p class=p1>“He looks like he’s warm,” Donna said with a laugh. “I think Travis, most of the time, wears things to make people laugh or smile. He does not take himself seriously. I hope everybody realizes that, but that is a nice outfit. I’m sure it was a cold day, so that was probably appropriate.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m%2FosLIrGSknZyYsm6wxKWgr52iqHqmwsSrpKiqlWLDqq7ErGSbnZakv6Z50q6lnZmpYrOwu9ObmKWkXZyurrGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
