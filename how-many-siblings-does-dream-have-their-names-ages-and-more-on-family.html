Her name is a combination of the words “Dream” and “Sista,” which TommyInnit gave her. Dream has also mentioned her in a few of his tweets, revealing that she enjoys Harry Styles and One Direction.</p><p>She has participated in numerous on-stream and in-video games on the Dream SMP using Dream’s account. The YouTubers Dream and GeorgeNotFound established the invite-only survival multiplayer (SMP) server known as Dream SMP. Dream’s sister acquired prominence following several visits to Dream SMP. She is her brother’s younger sister, at 15 years old, and they both live in Orlando, Florida.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dream-family-members-and-parents></span>Dream Family Members and Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dream has a younger sibling, but his identity, like his brother’s, is unknown. Along with that, Dream is also his sister’s younger brother. His older sister is by his side. But on top of that, nobody, not even his admirers, knows who his elder sister is.</p><p>Dream, who is 23 years old, was born on August 12, 1999. He became well-known thanks to his loyal fans, who helped him out often. Dream’s parents and other relatives are similarly hidden from view on the online platform because his identity has not yet been made public. According to the information on the internet, it can be inferred that he is obsessive about playing video games and streaming them on YouTube.</p><p>His family appeared to be supportive of his interests. Dream has been open about his condition since he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Dream is an agnostic, which means, in accordance with Wikipedia, that he holds that neither the existence of God nor the essence of God can be known or understood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dream-and-his-youtube-channel></span>Dream And His YouTube Channel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On February 8, 2014, Dream started uploading videos to his YouTube channel. He enjoys popularity among his followers, as evidenced by his more than 30 million subscribers and more than 2.9 billion cumulative views.</p><p>Dream also has six additional YouTube accounts where he posts a variety of content concerning Minecraft. His other YouTube accounts include Dream XD, Dream Manhunt, Dream Team, Dream Shorts, Dream Tech, and Dream Music. He received the Streamy Award for Gaming from YouTube in both 2020 and 2021.</p><p>After 2019, Dream began consistently posting new content to his account. His earliest video, which is still available, features him purposefully playing Minecraft poorly in order to “trigger” people. As of August 2021, the video had over 17 million views.</p><p>Dream’s most popular and well-liked show is “Minecraft Manhunt,” and he also took part in competitions that helped generate about $3,400 for charitable causes. In 2021, Dream said that he had given The Trevor Project, a charity for LGBT kids, US$140,000 (US$90,000 from fan donations and US$50,000 from the Dream Team). Despite having a positive reputation, he has been linked to various cheating and fraud scandals, which has made him a contentious figure.</p><p>As a result of his success, the YouTuber has also been mentioned in a number of news stories. In January 2021, Business Insider Steven Asarch attributed Dream’s growth in 2019 and 2020 “to his understanding of the YouTube algorithm.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqurc2yZKyhkqG2r7PSZpuonaNisbOxwKZkoZmmmnq1tMSiqWamkaKytHnAoJysZZGjsW65zqucZqeeYrOiucilsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
