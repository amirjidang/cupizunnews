Melissa Benoist and Chris Wood fell in love after costarring on Supergirl, and thankfully, their relationship had a happier ending than their onscreen alter-egos’.
The actor joined the CW series in season 2 as Mon-El, a love interest for the leading lady’s Kara Danvers (a.k.a. the titular superhero). As their characters’ romance blossomed on the show, so too did a spark develop between the portrayers.
