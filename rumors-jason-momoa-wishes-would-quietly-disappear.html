The actor has managed to find himself in some hot water throughout the last decade and has had a rumour of two come up surrounding himself, his relationship and his personal life.</p><p>Living in the spotlight can have its ups and downs, however, for Jason, it appears he's had quite a few things said against him. From cheating rumours to made up feuds and very questionable statements and fashion choices, here are 15 rumours Jason Momoa wishes would quietly disappear!</p><h2 id=his-feud-with-chris-pratt><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>His Feud With Chris Pratt</span></h2><p>While Jason Momoa manages to keep his scandals down to a minimum, he found himself in some hot water after posting a comment on one of Chris Pratt's Instagram photos. Pratt, who uploaded a photo of him post-workout and drinking out of a plastic water bottle, struck a nerve with Momoa, prompting him to call out the actor for his single-use plastic water bottle, having millions think the two were now feuding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-once-lived-with-tibetan-monks><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>He Once Lived With Tibetan Monks</span></h2><p>During an interview promoting 'Aquaman', Jason Momoa was asked a series of rapid-fire questions, one of which was a rumour of him once living with Tibetan monks, which is totally false! The actor was baffled to hear about it and was surprised to know that it's quite a big thing floating around the web.</p><h2 id=he-was-annoyed-with-his-snl-appearance><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Was Annoyed With His 'SNL' Appearance</span></h2><p>Jason Momoa hosted 'Saturday Night Live' back in December 2018, and did quite a spectacular job, however, after his appearance, rumours began surfacing that he was not happy with things at all. Jason allegedly was upset that he was written in so many scenes where he was shirtless, however, it turns out he was more than happy to oblige.</p><h2 id=the-reason-behind-his-golden-globes-outfit><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The Reason Behind His Golden Globes Outfit</span></h2><p>While this past year's awards season seems as if it was years ago, it was only last month! One of the biggest fashion moments came from Jason Momoa's tank top at the Golden Globes which sparked a number of people to think he was totally disrespecting the dress code when he was simply hot! The actor wore a stunning green blazer and took it off half-way through to breathe a little.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is Everything We Know About Jason Momoa's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=animal-cruelty-accusations><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Animal Cruelty Accusations</span></h2><p>Back in November 2019, Jason Momoa was discovered in a video of himself feeding a cookie to a grizzly bear! This is some major 'Tiger King' stuff, and many people were horrified to know that he visited a private zoo where animals are not treated all that well. While we still don't know all the details, Jason Momoa has assured his fans that he would never harm any animal.</p><h2 id=underlying-issues-with-lenny-kravitz><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Underlying Issues With Lenny Kravitz</span></h2><p>If you aren't familiar with Jason Momoa's situation, he is married to Lisa Bonet, who was previously married to Lenny Kravitz! The two began dating way back in the mid-2000s and married back in 2017. While the couple remains happy as can be, there was a lot of reported tension between Jason and Lenny during the earlier years, which is said to be completely untrue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=that-he-s-let-himself-go><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>That He's Let Himself Go</span></h2><p>It goes without saying that Jason Momoa has managed to find himself on the top of every "hottest" list there is, however, things took a turn last year! The actor was called out for developing a "dad bod", and losing his abs. Momoa quickly revealed that this was not done out of laziness, but in preparation for another role.</p><h2 id=his-alleged-fake-friendship-with-kit-harington><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>His Alleged Fake Friendship With Kit Harington</span></h2><p>Jason Momoa is mostly known for his role in 'Aquaman' and 'Justice League', however, one of his biggest projects was playing in "Game Of Thrones". Momoa starred alongside Kit Harrington, however, it is believed that Jason and Kit are not friends in real life, and put on an act in public for the sake of their reputations, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Magazine</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Pics Showing Jason Momoa & Henry Cavill's Bromance</a></span></p><h2 id=cheating-rumours-involving-emilia-clarke><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cheating Rumours Involving Emilia Clarke</span></h2><p>Jason Momoa may have only appeared in a total of 11 episodes of "Game Of Thrones" as Khal Drogo, however, it was just enough time to spark cheating rumours between he and co-star Emilia Clarke. The two managed to get extremely close, and with that came a lot of rumours speculating that the two were involved, when, in fact, they were simply good friends!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-reason-he-couldn-t-score-any-role-after-got><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Reason He Couldn't Score Any Role After 'GOT'</span></h2><p>This rumour is quite a silly one! After his stellar performance in 'Game Of Thrones', many Hollywood producers and casting agencies were under the impression that Jason did not actually speak English. This was clearly an unfortunate mistake, considering it cost him a lot of work after his 'GoT' appearance! Luckily for Jason, he definitely made up for it all.</p><h2 id=the-joke-that-went-too-far><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Joke That Went Too Far</span></h2><p>During his time on "Game Of Thrones", Jason Momoa, who appeared to be in costume, said working on the television series is amazing, as he gets to "rip people's tongues out" and "**** beautiful women". Momoa's comment in regards to sleeping with women without consent sparked a lot of heat around him and the show, causing many to believe he was very problematic. Jason immediately apologized for his remarks and made it clear that he does not stand by anything he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-the-talk-about-he-amp-wife-s-age-difference><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>All The Talk About He & Wife's Age Difference</span></h2><p>While it might be hard to grasp, Jason's wife, Lisa Bonet, is 52 years old, yes, 52! With Jason Momoa being only 40, many people took the 12 year age difference and ran with it. Rumours surrounding Lisa being twelve years Jason's senior sparked a lot of "sugar mama" and "cradle robber" remarks that were simply untrue and unkind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Pics Of Jason Momoa That'll Make You Want To Hit The Gym</a></span></p><h2 id=the-real-way-to-pronounce-his-name><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Real Way To Pronounce His Name</span></h2><p>While Jason Momoa is quite straightforward, the actor had to shorten his name to that in order for people to be able to say it properly. The stars actual name is&nbsp;Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa, however, he simply took his middle and last name in order to avoid any confusion with the 'Namakaeha' part, which everybody always managed to get wrong.</p><h2 id=that-he-uses-a-stunt-double><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>That He Uses A Stunt Double</span></h2><p>When it comes to his stunts, Jason Momoa manages to do it all! Rumours circulated during his time on 'Game Of Thrones', that Momoa always had a stunt double, however, all of that is false! Jason performed all of his own stunts in both "GoT" and "Justice League", and only needed one for a number of stunts in "Aquaman".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-moved-to-paris-to-pursue-painting><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Moved To Paris To Pursue Painting</span></h2><p>If you have ever looked over Jason Momoa's Wikipedia page, the actor allegedly moved to Paris way back when in order to pursue his love for painting. During an interview, Jason was asked about this life-changing move, where he then laughed it off and said he "hated Wikipedia" for that very reason, revealing that the rumour was completely untrue.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Things Jason Momoa Has Done To Prepare For A Role</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqWfp8ButsCspqdlnaS6sK2MsKCsoJWoeri71KWbZqmlnrK1uNhmm6KrkaW9pq3RaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
