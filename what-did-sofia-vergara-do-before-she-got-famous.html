Vergara told CBS in an interview that her mom immediately agreed to the idea, but she was not so sure because she was terrified of her Catholic school teachers seeing her in the commercial in a bikini.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm like, 'No, the nuns are gonna kill me, I can't be in a bathing suit on a commercial!'

But since she had just married her childhood sweetheart at that time, her family and husband felt that being a dentist was the only good option for her.</p><p>“What I was really interested in was medical school, but my husband and everyone said, ‘You’re a woman trying to have a family.

But of course, if I was just a pretty face, I wouldn't have lasted so long," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vergara told Harper's Bazaar in an interview</a>.</p><p>She also told Women's Health that when she moved to the U.S., she “worked like an animal”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I wanted to take advantage of my 15 minutes of fame because you never know.”</p><p>That's how <a href=#>Sofia Vergara became TV's highest-paid actress for seven years</a> straight at one point in time.
