This was true of <a href=#>the movie The Hangover, which used a few different Baby Carlos actors</a>. A set of twins enjoyed most of the limelight in that film.</p><p>Of course, twins like <a href=#>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen made millions off of a shared role on Full House</a>. But not every baby goes down in history for making a killing on movie scenes that they only drooled and spit up in.</p><p>In fact, some of the tots who portrayed a baby <a href=#>Harry Potter</a><strong> </strong>have remained unnamed and unknown, even all these years later.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-young-lily-potter-and-snape-actors-live-drastically-different-lives-since-the-deathly-hallows-part-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened To The Young Lily Potter And Snape Actors After Harry Potter?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What have Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 stars Ellie Darcey-Alden and Benedict Clarke been doing since they appeared in the franchise?</span><p><strong>Updated December 2023: </strong>Neither the Saunders triplets nor Toby Papworth went on to work in the entertainment industry after their stint on their respective 'Harry Potter' movies. Instead, the Saunders triplets decided to live a low-profile life and their names have not been divulged to this day. Papworth's mother created a Facebook page for him at the time that he appeared in 'Harry Potter'. She still maintains the page and updates it occasionally, showing that Papworth is a teen living his life post-'Harry Potter' days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-are-the-saunders-triplets>Who Are The Saunders Triplets?</h2><h3 id=the-saunders-triplets-played-harry-potter-in-harry-potter-and-the-sorcerer-39-s-stone>The Saunders Triplets Played Harry Potter In Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/maxresdefault-23-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Names of the Saunders triplets, two brothers and a sister, have not been revealed</strong></li></ul><p>Though Harry was already a tween by the time the franchise began, the flashback scenes posed a unique challenge for producers. They had to pick a baby who looked enough like Harry to be convincing, but the age had to be pretty close, too. Of course, the fact that the baby really only had to cry or sleep for their scenes made casting a bit easier.</p><p>But for the first film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, a set of three babies played Harry's role</a>. The Saunders triplets were cast in the role of infant Harry. The scenes were a bit uneventful. But it's understandable that producers would need a few options for babies, depending on which one was fussy, hungry, or wet at any given moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Saunders triplets could also be seen in archival footage of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

The first names of the baby boys and baby girl were never noted in the film's credits, according to Distractify, and their IMDb page doesn't include any other details. The trio never decided to go into the entertainment industry, living a low-profile life instead.</p><h2 id=toby-papworth---now-13-years-old>Toby Papworth - Now 13 Years Old</h2><h3 id=toby-papworth-played-harry-potter-in-harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-2>Toby Papworth Played Harry Potter In Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/toby-papworth-baby-harry-potter-deathly-hallows-film-1-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Papworth stopped acting after appearing in Harry Potter</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the baby who played Harry in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, that child had a name and a credit in the film.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toby Papworth was the baby who played a fussy Harry who'd just been through a traumatic event</a>.
