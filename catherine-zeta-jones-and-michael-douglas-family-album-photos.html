The Chicago star — whom Douglas called “extraordinary lady” in a 2019 interview with Us Weekly — shares son Dylan, born in 2000, and daughter Carys, born in 2003, with the Ant-Man actor, whom Zeta-Jones wed the same year the couple welcomed their son."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(The Kominsky Method alum is also father of son <strong>Cameron Douglas</strong>, whom he welcomed in 1978, with ex-wife <strong>Diandra Douglas</strong>.)</p><p>The Zeta-Jones/Douglas brood <a href=#>grew even bigger</a> in 2017, when Cameron welcomed his first-born, daughter Lua, with partner Viviane Thibes. The birth of Lua didn’t just make Michael and Zeta-Jones first-time grandparents, it also elevated <a href=#>Kirk Douglas</a> to <a href=#>great-grandparent status</a> before his death in February 2020. Nearly one year later, Cameron and Thibes welcomed a second child, son Ryder.</p><p>Prior to becoming a father, Cameron <a href=#>served nearly seven years in prison</a> after being convicted on drug charges. He was released in 2016, writing a memoir about his experiences that was published in 2019.</p><p>“It was my father who was really pushing me to write this book,” Cameron — who spent two years in solitary confinement — told <a href=#>Variety</a> in 2019. “I had trouble understanding that, because our family has always been very private. Then I realized it’s the ultimate way for my father and my mother to express their love for me, saying, ‘You have a story to tell that we think can be beneficial. Even though that will inevitably shine a light on pieces of our life that we’d have rather left in the past, for the greater good and because we love you, we’re giving you our blessing.'”</p><p>When reflecting on his two decades of marriage to Zeta-Jones, the Fatal Attraction star exclusively told Us in 2019 that he’s “always tried to remember how fortunate I am and what an extraordinary lady [Catherine] is and [remember daily] that kind of respect.”</p><p>Zeta-Jones, for her part, has also gushed about her husband over the years. At the November 2022 premiere of Wednesday, the Wales native told <a href=#>Extra</a> that she “thank[s[ my lucky stars every day that I picked the right guy.” She raved: “He’s a wonderful husband. He’s a wonderful father. He happens to be a wonderful actor. But for us, he’s just Michael.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mask of Zorro </a>actress is equally as effusive about her children, frequently sharing photos of her family via social media, whether she’s marveling over Carys and Dylan’s accomplishments, kissing her husband, or gushing over the grandkids.</p><p>In December 2022, Zeta-Jones shared a clip of Lua playing the drums — a moment that her step-grandma cherished.</p><p>“It gives me great joy to see Lua Douglas enjoying her 5th birthday gift from Bubba and Zeze, that’s my hubby and me!! Hahaha🤣🤣,” she captioned the Instagram video. “Bash it out Baby🤣 I can’t hear you! Gifting other people’s kids is so much fun.”</p><p>Cameron, for his part, spoke highly of his stepmom in a September 2021 birthday tribute to the star.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“A Happy Happy Birthday to one of the very best of the best,” he wrote alongside a photo of Zeta-Jones posing with Carys and Lua. “I Love you with all my heart ❤️💛💚@catherinezetajones.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the sweetest photos of the Zeta-Jones/Douglas family:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKLAx56poqaVYsemwMBmoaimlah6orrDZqSim5iWsq15w6isoKSRqHqnrcyio7JlkaGvtrmMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
