Rihanna is a workaholic so it’s nice to see her taking the time to flourish in motherhood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Rihanna-and-ASAP-Rockys-Son-Has-Brought-Them-So-Much-Closer.jpg><p>Since giving birth, Rihanna — who is <a href=#>set to headline the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show</a> in early 2023 — hasn’t shared any photos of their son or even revealed his name to the public, instead <a href=#>choosing to just enjoy the first months of parenthood</a> to the fullest. “We just didn’t get around to it yet really,” the “Work” singer told The Washington Post earlier this month. “We’ve just been living. But I guess there’s a certain freedom that comes with kind of just, like, getting it out there.”</p><p><a href=#>Rihanna and Rocky, who were first linked in December 2019</a>, have similarly kept their relationship out of the spotlight, with the “Sundress” rapper only confirming their romance in May 2021. “[It’s] so much better when you got The One. <a href=#>She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones</a>,” Rocky told GQ at the time, describing Rihanna as the “love of my life.”</p><p>He added: “I think when you know, you know. She’s The One.”</p><p>At the time, a source exclusively told Us that the pair were a “good match” for one another. “It’s obvious <a href=#>they’re a couple and also are each other’s best friend</a>,” the insider revealed. “They kid around a lot [and] laugh a lot. They have private date nights together a lot and have a blast hanging out together.”</p><p>Shortly after his son’s birth, <a href=#>Rocky hinted that he and Rihanna were hoping to have more children</a> in the future. “I will always remind my [future] children to never lose their imagination, even as adults, no matter what. I actually love to watch cartoons,” the New York native told Dazed Magazine in an interview published in May, shortly after Rihanna gave birth. “<a href=#>I hope to raise open-minded children</a>. Not people who discriminate. And I’m not trying to describe a saint, but realistically, I just want a cool child with cool parents.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added that “things like diversity and versatility are important,” and that he wanted his little ones to grow up with those values “embedded in the household.”</p><p>For more on Rihanna and ASAP Rocky, watch the exclusive video above — and pick up the latest Us Weekly&nbsp;issue on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaroZiWu6%2BtjJqlnWWRqK6xedGomqSxo2LAsLqMoZisZZKnvLazx61kraCVonq0u4ymrJygXZi5sL%2FEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
