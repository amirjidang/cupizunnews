In an interview with the Wichita Eagle, she described her father as a hands-on, present father.</p><p>In another interview with 20/20, she stated that she had to learn to live without her father as if he had died. She explained, “I had to learn how to grieve a man who wasn’t dead, someone I adored, but no one else did.” Darian Rawson and Kerri Rawson have been married since 2003. Kerri enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom when the children were still little, and the couple had two children (and two cats). Her Instagram bio currently reads, “Writer. Survivor. Fighter. Advocate.”</p><p>She has continued to speak out about her father’s misdeeds and how they have impacted her life. Their son, on the other hand, is a very private guy. He stays away from the press.

He enrolled in a local college in Wichita in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paula-Dietz-Husband.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Divorce><strong>Divorce</strong></span></h3><p>Paula Dietz’s marriage ended prematurely after her husband’s arrest and sentencing.
