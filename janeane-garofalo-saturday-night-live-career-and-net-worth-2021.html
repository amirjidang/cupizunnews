While she only lasted on SNL for one season, she was part of a very memorable cast that included Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, David Spade, and Mike Myers. In her short time at SNL she impersonated many famous women, including Madonna, Martha Stewart, Pamela Anderson, and even First Lady Hilary Clinton. She was not fired from the famous sketch comedy series, but rather she decided to leave <a href=#>on her own terms because she was not impressed with the comedy on the show that season</a>. Fortunately for Garofalo, leaving Saturday Night Live does not seemed to have harmed her career at all. Here is what happened to Janeane Garofalo's career in Hollywood and how much money she is worth today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sketch-comedy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sketch Comedy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Janeane-Garofalo-on-SNL.jpeg><p>To many people, Janeane Garofalo will always be best remembered for her sketch comedy work.
