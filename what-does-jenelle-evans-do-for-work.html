Yet Jenelle seems to have the lowest net worth of all the teen moms, and she might have left MTV without a financial safety net.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-mtv-pay-the-teen-moms>How Much Does MTV Pay The Teen Moms?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/teen-mom-2-nathan-griffith-slams-jenelle-evans-denies-cheating-says-relationship-is-over-e1621436649811.jpeg><p>Like the rest of the MTV Teen Mom cast, Jenelle Evans didn't start out earning a ton of money. The ladies who featured on 16 and Pregnant weren't necessarily given their paychecks up-front. In fact, teens like Catelynn and Tyler, who placed their first daughter for adoption, didn't have the financial benefit of an MTV windfall when their baby was born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Teen Mom Fans Are Disappointed By Jenelle Evans' Lack Of Growth, But Say It's Not Her Fault</a></span></p><p>But after years on Teen Mom and its spinoffs, all the moms were earning what seemed to be a decent income.</p><p>After a few years on the series, the teen moms were said to earn anywhere from $7,000 to $10,000 an episode. Yet the figure wasn't capped; some teen moms from the series are said to have made hundreds of thousands per year while working with MTV.</p><p>Adam Lind, who previously appeared on Teen Mom and was depicted as Chelsea DeBoer's verbally abusive and uninvolved baby daddy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed that MTV offered him $285K per year</a> but that he ultimately quit because of how he was portrayed.</p><p><a href=#>Other MTV dads have also made decent incomes</a> from the show, but none seem to have divulged their specific earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Either way, it's a massive paycheck considering Adam and the other dads aren't the main cast members; he claims the moms' earnings were substantially higher. Yet <a href=#>Chelsea eventually left MTV</a>, too, but for different reasons than her ex.</p><h2 id=jenelle-evans-39-net-worth-is-said-to-be-only-30-000>Jenelle Evans' Net Worth Is Said To Be Only $30,000</h2><p>Though MTV seemed to hand out cash quite easily to its Teen Mom cast, Jenelle Evans' net worth doesn't seem to reflect high earnings.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenelle is only worth $30,000</a>. That seems to mean that either she never earned much money on Teen Mom, or she spent most of it.</p><p>Evans is also said to have gone for substance abuse treatment various times, and she was known for being a partier during her early time on MTV.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Would Chelsea Houska Ever Return To Teen Mom? It Doesn't Seem Like It</a></span></p><p>Other teen moms are worth much higher amounts, even numbering in the millions. Even Kailyn Lowry, <a href=#>who fans thought shouldn't have left Teen Mom abruptly either</a>, wound up finding ways to bulk up her income.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Kailyn is worth somewhere around $1 million, according to various sources, and Farrah Abraham is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-net-worth former Teen Mom</a> at $5 million. Most of the veterans are worth between $1M and $3M.</p><p>But over the years, Jenelle has dabbled in various business ventures, so it doesn't seem that losing the Teen Mom paycheck totally ruined her future finances.</p><h2 id=how-is-jenelle-making-money-after-teen-mom>How Is Jenelle Making Money After Teen Mom?<img alt="Jenelle Evans talking Teen Mom" height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jenelle-Evans-talking-Teen-Mom.jpg width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p>With millions of followers between TikTok and Instagram, Jenelle Evans often posts sponsored content to her audiences. While it's not clear how much she earns per sponsored post, it can be assumed she's making a decent income with that side gig.</p><p>Jenelle also has a podcast, though it's unclear whether it's earning much income, but it may not matter.</p><p>In 2022, Janelle joined OnlyFans and reportedly started out making bank. She is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said to have earned around $40K per month</a> in the early days, based on calculations of her subscription prices and the number of subscribers at that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it's suggested that the amount may have decreased once the novelty of Jenelle being on OF wore off a bit (or subscribers simply signed up to see what it was all about).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Former Teen Mom Farrah Abraham Alleges That MTV Created Drama With Her Mom Debra</a></span></p><p>The former teen mom reportedly posts spicy content for her subscribers but also completes custom requests and "sells exclusive content."</p><p>Many fans have criticized Jenelle for her new job, but she pushed back against the critics by pointing out that OnlyFans is a real job (which she has to pay taxes on) and it's paying her bills.</p><p>It's unclear why Jenelle's quoted net worth is still so much lower than her former co-stars, especially if their MTV earnings were similar, but Evans doesn't seem to be concerned with what anyone else is doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Between her status as a social media influencer and her adult content, she doesn't seem to be having any trouble paying her bills.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmoZ6mlaG5pnnEr5inq12ZvG6yzqtksKeioHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
