On top of that, a lot of people become convinced that certain stars are dating even if they aren’t. For example, even though it is abundantly clear that Jack Dylan Grazer and Finn Wolfhard have never been a couple, some people are convinced that they have been.</p><h2 id=the-reason-why-some-people-think-that-jack-dylan-grazer-and-finn-wolfhard-are-a-couple>The Reason Why Some People Think That Jack Dylan Grazer And Finn Wolfhard Are A Couple</h2><p>In the year 2017, horror movie fans everywhere lined up to see the movie It, a film that focused on a group of kids fighting against an evil force that took the lives of their peers. Fortunately for everyone involved in that film, it was a massive success at the box office and fully embraced by viewers. Of course, there were many reasons why the film was such a success including Stephen King’s engrossing story and Bill Skarsgård's amazing portrayal of Pennywise. In fact, the film’s main villain was so freaky and popular that <a href=#>Skarsgård continues to be asked about playing Pennywise again</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pennywise: 20 Secrets About The Clown’s Anatomy</a></span></p><p>On top of the fact that horror film fans love Bill Skarsgård’s performance in It, the group of kids who starred in the 2017 movie has been highly praised as well. The reason for that is that all of them did a wonderful job making audiences invest in them as a group of friends that have been thrust into a terrifying situation.</p><p>When 2017’s It was released, the film’s young cast took part in a series of interviews in which it became clear that they all got along extremely well. Even though all of the It kids seemed close, it didn’t take long for it to become clear that Jack Dylan Grazer And Finn Wolfhard had a special bond. In fact, some people have even gone so far as to edit together video clips that showed the two actors having fun together and expressing their mutual admiration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Stranger Things’ Star Finn Wolfhard Worth?</a></span></p><p>For most people who took note of Grazier and Wolfhard’s obvious friendship, it was cute to see. For other people, however, seeing Grazier and Wolfhard displaying their friendship was evidence that the two actors actually were a couple in real life. Given the fact that Wolfhard and Grazier were children at the time people came to that conclusion, it is weird that anyone felt the need to gossip about them like that.</p><p>Amazingly enough, anyone who wanted proof of the fact that Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer really were a couple was seemingly provided proof by Wikipedia at one point. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grazier’s Wikipedia page briefly stated that the young actor was “dating Finn Wolfhard”</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it should go without saying that Wikipedia is an extremely useful resource. However, since anyone can edit a Wikipedia page, people should know to check sources whenever they read anything on the website and this story is a perfect example of why that is necessary. Thankfully, Grazer’s Wikipedia page was quickly edited to remove the reference to Wolfhard. However, loads of people would have read the actors were a couple by then and believed that was the case.</p><h2 id=jack-dylan-grazer-weighed-in-on-the-rumors-about-his-relationship-with-finn-wolfhard>Jack Dylan Grazer Weighed In On The Rumors About His Relationship With Finn Wolfhard</h2><p>If Jack Dylan Grazer and Finn Wolfhard developed feelings for one another and began dating once they were old enough, it would be great if they made each other happy. However, the truth of the matter is that all of the evidence points to the two young actors being friends and nothing more than that. Most notably, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grazer once denied that he and Wolfhard were a couple</a> that believers have nicknamed Fack during a Livestream Q and A. While he didn’t seem bothered by the rumors, Grazer also asked fans to move on from the rumors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“‘Fack’. Come on, guys, come on. Let’s give ‘Fack’ a rest, please. [...] It’s kind of annoying. [...] Guys, I don’t have a gay relationship with Finn, we all know that. It’s a joke.” What does it say about society that two male children can’t be open about their mutual admiration without people concluding they are a couple? On top of that, it is equally weird for similar reasons that so <a href=#>many people wanted Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown to become a couple in real life</a> when they were kids.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Close Are 'Stranger Things' Co-Stars Millie Bobby Brown And Finn Wolfhard?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmpubYrG6uMCnZKCqka%2Bys3nFoqWnZaekuae0wKubZpyRqbavs4ybprKeop6yr7CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
