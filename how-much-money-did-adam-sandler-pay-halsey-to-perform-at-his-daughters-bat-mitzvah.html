In addition, we'll also put the spotlight on how she was paid for the gig. <a href=#>Given his $250 million Netflix deal</a>, Sandler was more than okay with the payment. However, as we'll reveal, booking Halsey privately has quite the price tag attached.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-sandler-got-adam-levine-to-perform-at-sadie-s-bat-mitzvah-in-2019>Adam Sandler Got Adam Levine To Perform At Sadie's Bat Mitzvah In 2019</h2><p>Thanks to his Netflix money and net worth nearing the $500 million mark, cash is certainly not an issue for Adam Sandler. That was rather apparent for his daughters' Bat Mitzvah events. Back in 2019, <a href=#>he was able to get Adam Levine for the event</a>, who showed up last minute and played three of his songs.</p><p>Sandler retold the story during his time alongside Jimmy Kimmel, "And I was like, I... I didn’t even know why I did this, but I said, ‘I’d love to do something special for my daughter, I love her so much and blah, blah, blah.’ So I text … you know what I mean, everybody loves their daughter, but whatever,” Sandler said of his daughter Sadie. “And I text him, ‘I’m sorry to do this to you, my kid’s getting bat mitzvahed Saturday night. Would you mind coming and singing a few tunes? It would be incredible."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sandler admitted that he instantly regretted the ask, but was taken aback by the speedy response, “But I don’t know why I did it. Then you see the dot dot dot immediately. I’m like, ‘He got it and he’s about to say something."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Boys Features An Unlikely Adam Sandler Connection Fans Didn't Realize</a></span></p><p>Not only did Levine perform, but the actor revealed that he was a huge favorite with his daughter for pulling off the appearance. In truth, Sandler didn't try any less hard for the next Bat Mitzvah, which Halsey recently revealed.</p><h2 id=halsey-related-the-bat-mitzvah-to-coachella>Halsey Related The Bat Mitzvah To Coachella</h2><p>This time around, Halsey was the main act for Sunny's epic Bat Mitzvah. According to Halsey, the party was like something she had never seen before, <a href=#>comparing it to Coachella.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"First of all, it was the craziest bat mitzvah I’ve ever seen in my life,” Halsey told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.</p><p>“As you would expect from Adam Sandler. It was like… I mean, it was like Coachella. I couldn’t believe it. I was like, ‘Wow, you guys booked me?’ I was really honored.”</p><p>Halsey got emotional discussing the performance, calling it a full circle moment, given that she was a fan of Sandler's work from a young age. That also included her father, “My dad is a huge golfer and loved ‘Happy Gilmore’ and used to watch it all the time. So the first sentence I ever said in my life was, ‘Go to your home, ball."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Adam Sandler's Family</a></span></p><p>The guest list didn't just include Halsey, it also featured the likes of Adam's close friend Jennifer Aniston, along with Charlie Puth and Taylor Lautner.</p><p>We can only imagine how much the entire night cost Adam. What we do know, is that range to book Halsey for a private event is incredibly expensive... let's hope he got the childhood hero discount...</p><h2 id=halsey-s-booking-fee-usually-ranges-between-1-500-000--1-999-999>Halsey's Booking Fee Usually Ranges Between $1,500,000-$1,999,999</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Talent International, <a href=#>getting Halsey for a private event is quite pricey</a>. With a worth of $20 million, the artist is already established - meaning getting a booking won't come cheap.</p><p>The usual price range is between $1.5 million and just under $2 million. This is quite the number, though we assume the price range was lower for Adam, given that she didn't put on a full show and played select songs, likely in the range of three or four similar to Adam Levine.</p><p>Nonetheless, we're quite sure Halsey left the appearance with at least six-figures and let's face it, she also enjoyed quite the experience and one she'll never forget.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>What Roles Has Adam Sandler's Wife Jackie Played In His Biggest Movies?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMmpuapV2orq%2Bwy56pZqiRrnqprcusnLJlpKR6sbHRn6arpV2WwW60yKxknZmlnLW1sdGsZJuZpGK6qsDZr5ihZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
