But I don’t play those games. F**k a man. I Fear God.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While some may demand to know the names of who exactly did what, the songstress knows her story has value and will hold out for the right “price.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You won’t get it for free.
