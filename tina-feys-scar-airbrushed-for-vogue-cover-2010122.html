In Mario Testino's cover photograph, Fey, 39, appears without the small scar on the lower left side of her face.</p><p>In a 2008 Vanity Fair interview, Fey's husband Jeff Richmond explained that a stranger slashed Fey's face outside her home when she was five years old. The comedienne has declined to discuss the incident with press. "It's impossible to talk about it without somehow seemingly exploiting it," she told Vanity Fair.</p><p>The 30 Rock star doesn't mention her Photoshopped face in her new Vogue interview. But she does admit that she has a complicated relationship with fashion magazines and the supposed "negative messages" they send to young girls about body image.</p><p>"We're also the fattest country in the world," she says. "So it's not like we're all looking at fashion magazines and not eating."</p><p>Instead, Fey muses that the magazines kick off "a shame cycle: I'm never going to look like that model, so…Chicken McNuggets it is!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Not that she envies all of those "crazy skinny" models, anyway. "A lot of them are gigantic, with giant hands and giant feet," she explains.</p><p>"I feel like I represent normalcy in some way," she says of her stardom. In show biz, she explains, "People either represent youth, power, or sexuality. And then there's me, carrying normalcy…Me and Rachael Ray."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6m2r62Mn5yyq12osKK%2BjJqgq5qiqsCpscNmnaiqXau8qMHEZpqorpWnenN8kGloa2pf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
