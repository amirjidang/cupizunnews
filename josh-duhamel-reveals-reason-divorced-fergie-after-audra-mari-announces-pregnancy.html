He recently got married to Audra Mari, and the couple are expecting their first child together.</p><p>But that didn’t stop Josh from recently opening up about why he believes his marriage to Fergie didn’t last in the end. During an appearance on In Depth With Graham Bensinger, Josh explained that he struggled to deal with the attention and publicity that came from their relationship, especially since Fergie, 48, was at the height of her career.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/untitled-design-95.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Josh Duhamel Amassed His Massive Net Worth Since 'All My Children'">How Josh Duhamel Amassed His Massive Net Worth Since 'All My Children'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Josh Duhamel caught a big break with Transformers, so what happened to his net worth, and did his divorce from Fergie affect it?</p><p>“I don’t think I ever really got comfortable with all of it,” Josh, 50, explained. “I just missed the simplicity of who I really am, you know?”</p><p>“I’m just not a guy who is comfortable going to red carpets. Doing all the Hollywood stuff,” he said, implying that he and his ex may have diverged in their lifestyle preferences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-says-he-argued-with-fergie-over-where-their-family-should-live>Josh Says He Argued With Fergie Over Where Their Family Should Live</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/spl5445973_001.jpg><p>Furthermore, Josh says they couldn’t decide where to raise their family permanently (the former couple share a 10-year old son, Axl). Though work kept them both in Los Angeles regularly, Duhamel hailed from North Dakota, whereas Fergie was from Southern California.</p><p>The pair were married for a decade, from 2009 to 2019 (they officially separated in 2017), though they dated for many years before tying the knot.</p><p>“With absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,” the parents-of-one said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive statement to PEOPLE at the time</a>. “To give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public,” they continued. “We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, in his recent interview, Josh says they remain on good terms despite their split, and are committed to co-parenting their son.</p><h2 id=josh-relocated-to-north-dakota-and-is-now-remarried>Josh Relocated To North Dakota And Is Now Remarried</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/screen-shot-2023-09-13-at-12-12-56-am.png><p>He said despite personally wanting to move back to North Dakota, Josh realized it wasn’t what his then-wife would be happy with in the long-term. “I made peace with that part of my life. She and I have a great relationship,” Josh went on. “There wasn’t anything wrong with it. We had a great time. I think we kind of outgrew each other and had very different interests.”</p><p>“I’ve got no hard feelings for it.
