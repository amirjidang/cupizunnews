When we finished filming, I had sort of a nervous breakdown,” the reality star, 47, explained on SiriusXM’s <a href=#>The Jeff Lewis Show</a> on Wednesday, June 28. “I think I just went for four months hard when we were filming and I ate too much, drank too much, and just didn’t get enough sleep, didn’t exercise.”</p><p>Simpson told <strong>Jeff Lewis</strong> that she wanted to let her followers know that she didn’t just shed pounds “all of a sudden” in a “very short period of time” despite what they are seeing on season 13 of RHOC.</p><p>After seeing a doctor amid her depression and weight gain, “I did a full blood panel,” Simpson shared. “My cholesterol was high. I have zero testosterone. I was pre-diabetic, so she actually said, ‘Why don’t you do a semaglutide?’ which is Ozempic, so I did. I did that in December.”</p><p>The California resident added that she was on Ozempic for one month. (Per the FDA, Ozempic and Wegovy, another semaglutide, are <a href=#>typically used for chronic weight management</a> or to aid in a weight-related condition such as type 2 diabetes.)</p><p>Though Simpson said her Ozempic use was a “great kickstart for me … [to lose] five to seven pounds,” she ultimately went off the drug because it “made me feel lethargic and it made me just not have a lot of energy, which was hard with three little kids.” Emily and husband<strong> Shane Simpson</strong> share daughter Annabelle, 10, and twin boys Luke and Keller, 7. (Shane is also the father of two daughters from a previous marriage.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RHOCs-Emily-Simpson-Admits-to-Ozempic-After-Previously-Shutting-Down-Rumors-Details-Weight-Loss3.jpg><p>While Emily is one of several Housewives — including <a href=#><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Margaret Josephs</strong></a> — to now admit to using a semaglutide or a similar drug for weight loss, she previously <a href=#>appeared to shut down the claims</a> from fans who accused her of using Ozempic.</p><p>“You don’t know me and nothing will ‘revert back’ bc my arms are jacked from heavy lifting,” Emily responded to her followers via Instagram on Friday, June 23.</p><p>Emily went on to tell <strong>Jeff Lewis</strong> that she had liposuction on her arms, revealing that her arms had “always bothered” her, so she got a “new” liposuction treatment. She also got a breast reduction.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I healed from that and I came out of it, you know, eight weeks later or whatever, I looked completely different. … I felt like it was just a huge difference in my overall look just to have the thinner arms and just the smaller chest and I was so happy with the surgery, and I have so much muscle underneath that when he did the liposuction, my arms were just jacked,” she explained.</p><p>Still, it wasn’t just the immediate weight loss from Ozempic and <a href=#>the plastic surgery that changed her look</a>, Emily explained. “Once all [the fat from my arms] was gone, I was like, “Damn, you can tell I’ve been working out for all these years,” she said. “I was so inspired by seeing this muscle that I just hard-core went a completely different route with food. I became very conscientious of what I was eating. I changed my diet completely. I eat mostly protein, very little carbs, and I work out like six, seven days a week.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaroJ%2BYwG6xzKKjsmWjnrqxv86nZJqcnZ7BtHnTqGSuq5mjtG672Z6kqaGTYrGmwMCio6xlp5q2qLTTZqOoq6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
