None more so than the one she allegedly had with TikTok star Hunter Echo.</p><h2 id=the-live-stream-that-stirred-up-a-ton-of-controversy>The Live Stream That Stirred Up A Ton Of Controversy</h2><p>There's no doubt that something went on between the two attractive celebrities. After all, there are photos of them kissing. But the extent of their encounters is up for debate.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumors of a sexual relationship</a> between the then 20-year-old TikTok star and the then 16-year-old Stranger Things actor were shut down by Millie, according to The Daily Mail. She also claimed that Hunter 'Echo' Ecimovic 'groomed' her since he was older. This is something many of her fans, as well as the media, also believes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Millie Bobby Brown Celebrates International Women’s Day With A Heartfelt Message</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These comments infuriated Hunter, who got together with his friends on an Instagram live stream to shed light on the true nature of their relationship... at least, from his point of you. And his point of view was absolutely intoxicated, as it was both visually and audibly obvious that he was drunk. This was also later confirmed by Hunter.</p><p>In the live stream, which lasted for hours, Hunter and his friends threw out all sorts of allegations and&nbsp;nasty comments about the Stranger Things star. Most importantly, they made claims about her sexual relationship with the TikTok star when she was just 16.</p><p>Be advised that some may find Hunter's comments inappropriate or even disturbing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She was obsessed. In love. Wouldn't f***ing leave his side."</p><p>Hunter went on to say that he was sleeping at Millie's house for 8 whole months and her parents knew about what was going on between them. Then added,&nbsp; "Millie would never address it because she was a coward."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Drake's Relationship With Millie Bobby Brown</a></span></p><p>Of course, many of Millie's fans were commenting on the live stream&nbsp;simultaneously and this only got him and his friends more riled up. Hunter&nbsp;even claimed that Millie 'manipulated' him with her powers and made him do some very personal and 'strange' things to him including a coffee enema.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the video, multiple fans, including the one who recorded it and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted it on Youtube for all to see</a>, called Hunter out for taking advantage of a younger girl. But this is something he denied.</p><p>"Everything I did was completely legal and it was approved by everybody that I was with," Hunter said.&nbsp;"I have nothing to apologize for, so make that clear. I have zero things to apologize for. You guys do not know a single thing at all."</p><p>He continued by saying that everyone just follows the other without really thinking about it.</p><p>While Hunter seemed to dig his heels into the ground on this issue, he was soon forced to change his tune. Not only because both his Twitter and Instagram accounts got suspended but because Millie's reps got involved in a big way...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=millie-struck-back-through-her-team>Millie Struck Back Through Her Team</h2><p>The response from Millie's representation was swift and claimed that the TikTok star was completely out of line.</p><p>"Mr. Ecimovic’s remarks on social media are not only dishonest but also are irresponsible, offensive and hateful,” Millie Bobby Brown's presentation told TMZ, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Complex</a>. "Instead of engaging in a public discourse with him through the press or on social media, we are taking action to ensure that he stops this behavior once and for all."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are 'Stranger Things' Co-Stars Millie Bobby Brown And Finn Wolfhard?</a></span></p><p>Clearly, Millie's legal representatives scared Hunter as he issued an apology shortly after, despite saying that he had "nothing to apologize for". Given that her representatives insinuated that an investigation would take place into the legal ramifications of Hunter's alleged sexual relationship with the&nbsp;much younger star, it makes sense that he'd try to calm things down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should be noted that the legal age of consent in England (Mille's home country) is 16, 18 in L.A. (where Millie and Hunter both spend a lot of time) and TMZ found no open investigation with L.A. law enforcement.</p><p>In his apology video, Hunter said that he thought his "drunken" live stream video got out of hand and reflected terribly on him, his family, and his friends.</p><p>"I am sorry for doing that live stream, I should have ended it the moment it started getting bad. But I chose not to, I said what I said, and I can't take that back," Hunter said. "I just want you to know that I'm not OK with what I said. I'm not trying to justify it at all. I just want you guys to know that I'm not OK with how I went about stuff."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While all of this stuff is hotly controversial, it's fair to say that Hunter acted outlandishly inappropriately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Millie grew up way too fast</a>, and her parents made some highly questionable decisions.</p><p>Then again, we clearly don't know the entire story.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Millie Bobby Brown & Gaten Matarazzo Get Vaccinated To Film ‘Stranger Things’ Season 4</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rrXLpaCeZZKkr6PFjJupqK%2BeYq6vsIyhrKeslad6pq%2FHqGSem5mivLe1wqxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
