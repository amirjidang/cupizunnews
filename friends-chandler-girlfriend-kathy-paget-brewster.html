In 2022 alone, the star took part in seven productions, one of which being a recurring podcast series called The Thrilling Adventure Hour: Beyond Belief.</p><p>So far this year, Brewster has acted in an episode of the show The Great North as well as her starring role on the TV series Criminal Minds. With 101 titles on her resume, it doesn't look like Paget will be slowing down any time soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-kathy-leave-friends>Why Did Kathy Leave Friends?</h2><p>Although it turns out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross and Rachel's chemistry might have leaked over into real life</a>, the same didn't happen with Chandler and Kathy. What did happen, however, was that the actress behind Kathy grew close with the rest of the cast.</p><p>That didn't save her from having an unsatisfying end in the Friends series, though. Paget Brewster played Kathy for six episodes of the sitcom, starting in 1997. Ultimately, as fans know, Kathy cheated on Chandler and was written off the show in 1998. It wasn't because she fell out with her co-stars, though.</p><p>In fact, the crew asked the producers to give Kathy a less dramatic exit, but they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly refused</a>, and Kathy -- aka Paget Brewster -- was history. Though <a href=#>some say Monica was the glue holding everyone together</a>, other supporting cast members were cornerstones, too.</p><h2 id=what-did-paget-brewster-do-after-friends>What Did Paget Brewster Do After Friends?</h2><p>Fortunately for Brewster, Friends wasn't her only chance at fame. She has gone on to have quite the career in Hollywood, nabbing multiple TV movie and series roles right after departing from Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar48159648.jpg><p>She has credits on everything from animated DC and MCU shows to Law & Order: SVU to Criminal Minds. In fact, her role as Emily Prentiss on Criminal Minds lasted an astonishing 14 years (and almost 200 episodes), cementing her as a TV series expert.</p><p>Brewster also voiced Della Duck on DuckTales, and she has had recurring and various roles on American Dad! over the years, too. Of course, Paget has noted in interviews that there is one thing she still hopes to accomplish in her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar41934703.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She once laughed, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I really want to play evil ladies!</a>" Sounds like an intriguing career path, and Paget says it fits because she is "growing into what you would call a patrician or handsome woman." Interesting take, but the actress says part of evolving as an actor is being unafraid, and she definitely has the chops.</p><h2 id=what-does-paget-brewster-say-about-her-time-on-friends>What Does Paget Brewster Say About Her Time On Friends?</h2><p>Paget is clearly the multi-talented cast addition that Friends desperately needed. Even if producers didn't realize it at the time, the rest of the cast sure did, and they hated to see Brewster go.</p><p>Still, Paget credits Friends with giving her a "pretty incredible break." Appearing on the show was "the most exciting thing," the actress said years later, and it really cemented the idea of acting as a career in her mind.</p><p>And the rest is history!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecKhmKecnJq%2FbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V5ypqrobFdpa6osdNmmaudp6jBpr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
