The business became widely successful that she decided to buy out the equity of her partner to be the sole owner of the business. In 1977, she was <a href=#>hired to cater for a book release</a> event where she met the head of Crown Publishing Group, Alan Mirken. She discussed with him the idea of publishing a cookbook which will feature some of the recipes which she used for her catering events. The idea was eventually idealized as she published her first cook book in 1982 which sold about 625,000 copies.</p><p>Her success did not stop there; she continued publishing cook books from 1983 until 1989. With her cook book’s success across the country, she was already making a name for herself. Soon, she began to regularly appear on a lot of well watched TV programs including The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Tonight.
