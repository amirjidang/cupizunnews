They later sold the company to Wendy’s, which is owned by Dave Thomas, in 1995 for $600 million.</p><p>Ron and Tim reportedly first met in the early 1960's when Joyce visited the Tim Horton Doughnut Shop while on patrol and they became business partners. The former policeman then followed his gut and opened two more restaurants under the same name in 1967 and became a full partner for Horton.</p><p>In 1974, Horton died in a car accident. Mr. Joyce bought his partner’s shares and became the sole owner of the doughnut chain who was later known as the Doughnut King of Canada. After the Wendy’s transaction in 1995, he became the largest single shareholder of the fast food chain who gained more than $16 million shares.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ronald Joyce sold all of his shares to Wendy’s in 2003 and has invested the money in other Canadian companies which have paid considerable dividends for him. He currently owns an aircraft charter company and the Fox Harb’r golf resort in the north shore of Nova Scotia.
