The Estevez’s have been in entertainment for three generations now, and both their stage name of Sheen and their birth name Estevez are attached to some of the most prominent and legendary people in Hollywood. The Estevez/Sheen name is a brand that is both lucrative and notorious in Hollywood. Charlie’s brother Emilio was beloved by millennial kids thanks to his tenure in the 1990s <a href=#>Mighty Ducks</a> franchise, and his father became an icon thanks to his dark performance of a disillusioned soldier in the magnum opus of director Francis Ford Coppola, Apocalypse Now.</p><p>Charlie Sheen has had a lot of financial ups and downs thanks to his controversial behavior. Lawsuits and alimony payments abound for the actor, but what about his equally famous family? How much financial clout does the <a href=#>Estevez/Sheen</a> brand really carry?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Charlie Sheen</span></h2><p>Let’s start with Charlie himself. Despite multiple legal issues, especially a highly publicized divorce from actress <a href=#>Denise Richards</a>, Sheen still sits on a net worth of approximately $10 million. Because of his notorious reputation of being difficult to work with, Sheen hasn't been in many projects lately and his show Anger Management was canceled due to complications caused by Sheen’s HIV diagnosis. However, even though it was only filmed for a few seasons, the show managed to produce 100 episodes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Charlie Sheen Ever Recover His $150 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=martin-sheen><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Martin Sheen</span></h2><p>Sheen’s father <a href=#>Martin</a> is a Hollywood legend thanks to his performance in Apocalypse Now, which is widely considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made. He is also beloved thanks to his performances in television shows like Netflix’s Grace and Frankie and the hit political thriller, Aaron Sorkin’s The West Wing. Apocalypse Now grossed $100 million alone and Sheen earned a healthy $300,000 per episode while starring on The West Wing. In 2021, Martin Sheen boasts a substantial <a href=#>$70 million net worth </a>and is the richest member of his family.</p><h2 id=emilio-estevez><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Emilio Estevez</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheen’s brother <a href=#>Emilio</a> worked constantly in the '80s and '90s but suffered a bit of a slow down in the 2000s until coming back recently in a Mighty Ducks reboot on Disney+. Emilio can also be seen in '80s classics and cult classics like The Breakfast Club or the sci-fi film Repo Man, where he acted alongside a Hollywood icon similar to his father, Harry Dean Stanton, who also had debaucherous habits similar to his brother Charlie’s. Despite his career slowdown in the 2000s, Emilio is worth $18 million today. Even though his brother had worked more on camera than him in recent years, Emilio sits on a larger amount of money than the troubled Charlie does.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Emilio Estevez The Richest Member Of His Family?</a></span></p><h2 id=ramon-estevez><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ramon Estevez</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although he successfully keeps a much lower profile than his brothers Charlie and Emilio and their father Martin, Ramon Estevez is still gainfully employed in the family industry as both an actor and a director, and he also runs Estevez Sheen Productions, the family production company. Ramon has helped his brother Charlie to continue working when he signed on as a producer for Sheen’s sitcom Anger Management. While it is a meager amount compared to his father’s and both of his brothers’ net worths, Ramon can claim a respectable $3 million.</p><h2 id=renee-estevez><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Renee Estevez</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlie’s only sister follows in the family tradition and works in Hollywood both as an actress and screenwriter. She can be seen in the 1980s cult favorite Heathers and like Ramon Estevez, she worked with Charlie on his show Anger Management as a writer. She has not acted since 2015 and is worth $3 million today, the same amount as Ramon.</p><h2 id=joe-estevez><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Joe Estevez</span></h2><p>Joe Estevez is Martin Sheen’s younger brother and Charlie’s only uncle, and he chose a slightly different career path than the rest of his family. While Martin made a career out of appearing in Oscar and Emmy-winning projects and working with legendary directors like Coppola and Sorkin, Joe Estevez made a career as a B-movie institution. Oftentimes, his films are very low-budget, straight-to-video projects and are rarely seen by a mainstream audience except for their occasional appearances in movie riffing shows. However, Joe’s voice and appearance make him a dead ringer for his brother and he has occasionally filled in for him on mainstream projects. For example, he provided the voice-over narration for his brother’s character in Apocalypse Now because Sheen was too ill at the time. Titles under Joe’s belt include Soultaker, Werewolf, Baby Ghost, and the bizarre Roller Gator. Films featuring Estevez are regularly lampooned by the movie riffing website Rifftrax and at least two of his films have been featured on the famous riffing series, Mystery Science Theater 3000. Believe it or not, B-movies have been good to Joe because he is worth $5 million today thanks to his cult film career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Truth About Jon Cryer And Charlie Sheen's Relationship Today</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5lk52us7jInmSsoJWau7R5xZqkoqSpYrqmucGeqaxlp6S%2FtbSMoqVmamBnfnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
