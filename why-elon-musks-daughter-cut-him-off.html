The billionaire has 10 children. He shares his youngest child, a daughter, with <a href=#>his off-and-on girlfriend, singer Grimes</a>. They welcomed the baby in December 2021 via surrogate.

As for his oldest children, the SpaceX founder shares 6 children with his ex-wife Justine Wilson. Their first child, a son, died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDs) at 10 weeks old in 2000. Afterwards, the couple used IVF to expand their family, and welcomed twins in 2004 followed by triples in 2006.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Grimes And Kanye West Are Helping Elon Musk With His Most Ridiculous Project Yet</a></span></p><p>Though Elon may have a lot of children, he doesn’t appear to have equally close relationships to all of them, especially his eldest kids. In fact, his daughter recently made headlines for publicly disowning and distancing herself from him, causing speculation over what prompted such a serious move. Here’s everything we know about Elon’s severed relationship with his daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-musk-daughter-changed-her-name-and-gender>Elon Musk Daughter Changed Her Name And Gender</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-1-7.jpg><p>Despite Elon’s celebrity status, most of his children live away from the spotlight. For example, his eldest children don’t even have public social media profiles. Little is known about who they are or what their lives look like, considering their high-profile father. Moreover, there are few details about what Elon’s relationship is like with them, including how frequently he sees them in-person.</p><p>That’s why it was major news in June 2022 when one of Elon’s 18-year-old twins applied for a legal name and gender change with the Los Angeles County Superior Court after becoming legal. The teen requested her gender be changed to female and her new legal name to be Vivian Jenna Wilson. She notably dropped her father’s famous last name in exchanged for her mother Justine Wilson’s maiden name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked for the reason for the change, Vivian clearly stated it was part of an effort to distance herself from her father. "Gender Identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote in court documents</a>.</p><p>Vivian’s requested was approved shortly after and a new birth certificate was issued.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elon Musk's Dad Has Been Wrapped Up In Even More Bizarre Controversies Than The Multi-Billionaire</a></span></p><p>Elon didn’t issue a comment, despite the news making international headlines. Speculation quickly spread that the billionaire is unsupportive of his daughter’s gender transition, hence her desire to distance herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Elon has a history of being unsupportive towards the LGBTQ+ community. He’s previously complained about people using self-chosen pronouns. Elon did, however, clarify that doesn’t mean he’s anti-transgender. "I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an aesthetic nightmare,” <a href=#>he tweeted in 2020</a>.</p><p>Moreover, the businessman has publicly declares his support for Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who’s best known for introducing a “Don’t Say Gay Bill,” a law wanting to prevent teachers from opening up about their sexual orientation and gender identity in school.</p><h2 id=elon-rsquo-s-ex-wife-supports-their-daughter-rsquo-s-decision-to-sever-ties>Elon’s Ex-Wife Supports Their Daughter’s Decision To Sever Ties</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/elon-musk-girlfriend-type-ex-wife-justine-musk.jpg><p>While Elon may be outspoken, his first ex-wife remains a relatively private life, much like their kids. But shortly after the news made headlines, Justine did make it clear where she stands after their daughter’s name and gender change – and she’s supporting Vivian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Opening up on Twitter</a>, the author referred to herself as “proud” of her daughter’s latest moves, seeming to imply that not only does she support Vivian’s decision, but also her choice to distance herself from her father. “‘I had a weird childhood,’ my 18-year-old said to me,” she said of an exchange she had with one of her twin, presumably Vivian. “I can’t believe I’m as normal-seeming as I am.”</p><p>In response, Justin recalls saying, “I’m very proud of you.” To this, her teen replied, “I’m proud of myself!”</p><h2 id=speculation-suggests-elon-musk-may-have-given-up-on-having-a-relationship-with-his-daughter>Speculation Suggests Elon Musk May Have Given Up On Having A Relationship With His Daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon-musk-in-a-black-suit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elon didn’t stay silent on his daughter’s gender transition for long, but unfortunately, his response seems to confirm speculation that their relationship is strained because of it.</p><p>"It's full-on communism […] and a general sentiment that if you're rich, you're evil,"<a href=#> the Tesla CEO told Financial Times</a> last October. "It [the relationship] may change, but I have very good relationships with all the others [children]. Can't win them all."</p><p>Perhaps with 10 children, Elon can’t afford to spread his time too thin on the ones that don’t want a relationship with him. However, his comment was perceived publicly as lacking motivation to fix the relationship with his eldest daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Errol Musk's True Feelings About His Son Elon Aren't Nearly As Horrible As Some Believe</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the other children he shares with Justine, little is known about how they feel towards their famous father. A few years after their divorce in 2008, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon said they split custody evenly</a>.</p><p>“Custody of our five children is split evenly,” he said in 2010. “Almost all of my nonwork waking hours are spent with my boys, and they are the love of my life.”</p><p>He also claimed to be paying $20,000 a month for their kids’ expenses, including clothes, food, and the nanny’s salary. However, considering Elon went on to become the world’s richest person in the years following, it’s likely the child support bill went up. But that’s not to say his relationship with his kids necessarily benefited.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmrmwuoymrKyjo2KxosHGoaueql2YwrV5x6KkZqeWm3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
