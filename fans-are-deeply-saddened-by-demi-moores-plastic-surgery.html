She began by telling fans how important and meaningful this experience was to her. Clearly more than a job or a moment of status, Demi Moore had a strong emotional connection to opening the runway for Fendi at the prestigious Paris Fashion Week event. She posted a very chic video on Instagram, alongside the caption; "Fulfilling a teenage dream... Thank you <a class=notranslate href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@mrkimjones</a> for having me open the <a class=notranslate href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Fendi</a> SS21&nbsp;show and congratulations on a beautiful and magical debut!"</p><p>Fans that were initially drawn to her commentary and clicked to see more, were suddenly met with an unfamiliar face, and there didn't seem to be a single comment suggesting Demi's aesthetic change was for the better. This "teenage dream" of hers didn't imply she had to try looking like a teenager.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama June Fans Wonder Where She Got $75,000 For Plastic Surgery Amid Drug Battle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-went-too-far-with-plastic-surgery>She Went 'Too Far' With Plastic Surgery</h2><p>It appears that Demi Moore has had more than just a 'nip and tuck' done. Way more. Many fans were quick to say she was "unrecognizable", and a quick scroll through her social media channels reveals grave concern for Moore's well-being. The biggest point of contention to fans was the fact that Demi Moore was truly gorgeous to start. A natural beauty didn't need to undergo such extensive, excessive facial procedures, nor does it seem to particularly suit her.</p><p>Moore has publicly suffered through a great deal of physical and mental health issues, and this facial procedure alerted fans to the potential of something being very wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan wrote; "Love you, always have BUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE ðŸ˜­," and another commented by saying; "Send your cosmetic surgeon to jail! You were so beautiful ðŸ–¤." Other comments included; "you didn't need cosmetic surgery," and "Looks like someone slashed your cheeks like a Glasgow smile. ðŸ˜¢"</p><p>There was one person who said; "Demi we love you, you don't need plastic surgery. Please stop, we are worried. Please stop messing with your face."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Plastic Surgery Nearly Killed Heidi Montag</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYydnJ6onK56tK3DnZynnZRir7p5w56komWdpLyzsdJmp6WZo6m2pHnSrqmgnaKufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
