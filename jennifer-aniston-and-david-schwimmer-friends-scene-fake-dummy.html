And I kept saying, 'What are you talking about?' And then I went online to see what was happening, and I was like, 'That is the funniest rumor that I never heard that got shot down in the quickest amount of time.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Made The 'Friends' Crowd Gasp When She Made This Mistake</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the two would in fact admit that there was a bit of truth to the rumors during the earlier seasons. According to the 'Friends' duo, <a href=#>they crushed on each other during the earlier seasons.</a></p><p>"At some point, we were both crushing hard on each other," Schwimmer continued. "But it was like two ships passing, because one of us was always in a relationship. And we never crossed that boundary. We respected that."</p><p>Off camera, the two got along extremely well. However, in this instance, Aniston was not happy with Schwimmer's antics. Let's take a look at how it all went down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-wasn-t-happy-with-schwimmer-s-on-screen-prank>Jennifer Aniston Wasn't Happy With Schwimmer's On-Screen Prank</h2><p>The episode in question aired way back in February of 2001. '<a href=#>The One with the Truth About London' took place in season 7</a>, episode 16. The main plot surrounded how Monica and Chandler really hooked up in London, though one of the other storylines saw Rachel try to become the cool aunt alongside Ben.</p><p>In the episode, Ross wasn't happy with Rachel's approach, as she was teaching Ben various pranks - that he would later test out on his dad.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>‘Friends’: Jennifer Aniston Shares Underrated Deleted Scene Blooper</a></span></p><p>David Schwimmer actually directed the episode. He decided to have some fun during the final scene, airing a real prank that actually aired. The moment was completely unscripted, as Ross used a fake dummy to throw down the stairs, just as Rachel was trying to catch up to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aniston was not told about the moment, which made her reaction that much greater. It turns out, she was none too pleased with not being told, and we can see the anger on her face after the moment took place. Schwimmer on the other hand was all laughs, along with the audience who also had a blast with the moment.</p><p>What did the fans think of the scene? Well, it should come as a surprise that they completely loved it.</p><h2 id=how-did-the-audience-react-to-unscripted-moment>How Did The Audience React To Unscripted Moment?</h2><p>Fans were all over this moment rewatching it on YouTube. The clip has nearly one million views.

The shrill of her scream is genuine, the audience were in hysterics and the look on her face is of torment and anger."</p><p>"This episode was directed by David Schwimmer, he intentionally didn't tell Aniston about the doll, which is why she looks so very pissed at the end."</p><p>"Since they said the last part was JA's genuine reaction, I wonder what script she was told instead of the doll."</p><p>"I love it when it's obvious that she really got scared with david schwimmer's prank but she still tried to stay in character by calling ross instead of david."</p><p>One of the many great moments to take place on the show - though this one is a little more special given that it was not part of the script.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Begged To Leave This Failing Sitcom Before 'Friends'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bq3NnWSdmaaesW6%2FwqGuoqWdmr9ustGinKeco2LApLHNnmSfmZuaeqXBzKawaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
