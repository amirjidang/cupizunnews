Then came their breakup, which spurred even more hit songs, but also occurred right as Shawn was about to go on tour. Unfortunately, he would soon share that the tour was coming to an end just as it was getting started, and fans weren't thrilled about what happened next.</p><h2 id=shawn-mendes-canceled-tour-dates-to-focus-on-his-mental-health>Shawn Mendes Canceled Tour Dates To Focus On His Mental Health</h2><p>While in the middle of a tour, <a href=#>Shawn Mendes announced that he would be postponing shows</a> for his mental health. The first few shows had seemed to go off without a hitch, with Mendes posting to social media afterward and thanking his fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the news came on the heels of <a href=#>Shawn's spilling some personal details</a> about what he was going through, and at first, fans were very sympathetic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Shawn Mendes Releases Emotional Song Following Split From Camila Cabello">Shawn Mendes Releases Emotional Song Following Split From Camila Cabello</a></span></p><p>Mental health is no joke, after all, and many celebrities have expressed how challenging tour schedules can be.</p><p>Other celebrities like <a href=#>Justin Bieber have experienced similar demands on their minds and bodies</a> for the sake of touring, and fans don't want to see their favorite performers hurting themselves in the name of entertainment.</p><p>But shortly after Shawn pulled out of his tour lineup, fans began to wonder what was really going on.</p><h2 id=after-canceling-shawn-started-posting-his-travel-adventures>After Canceling, Shawn Started Posting His Travel Adventures</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though fans were sympathetic when Shawn canceled his concerts, they began questioning his motives when he began posting travel photos shortly after.</p><p>Instead of sticking close to home or taking a break from social media, both things that fans would understand, given Shawn's admissions, Shawn seemed to go out partying and traveling.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Shawn Mendes Is Focusing On His Spirituality Post-Camila Cabello">Shawn Mendes Is Focusing On His Spirituality Post-Camila Cabello</a></span></p><p>One fan expressed their unhappiness over Shawn's public displays by saying, "now he is well enough to party in Miami and hook up with some girl on [a] yacht but not well enough to go and do his job."</p><p>And he did post photos of himself on a yacht shortly after canceling his tour stops.</p><p>Other fans, though, argued that blowing off steam and enjoying himself was totally fine for Mendes to do, given how much he had been living in the spotlight to that point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just because he canceled his shows for mental health issues didn't mean he had to look or act miserable all the time, they pointed out.</p><h2 id=was-shawn-dishonest-about-why-he-canceled-his-shows>Was Shawn Dishonest About Why He Canceled His Shows?</h2><p>A few fans on Reddit surmised that perhaps Shawn was still feeling blue over his breakup with Camila Cabello.</p><p>True, he did write a song about their split (and the lyrics lamented not having enough time together), and it did sound like Camila might have driven the breakup.</p><p>Thus, fans thought he might have canceled his shows because he was still sad over the split.
