The case will be featured on “Dateline: Secrets Uncovered” on March 8, 2023.</p><p>After Linda’s disappearance, the case went unsolved, and tragically, her mother, Marilyn Cox and friend Renee Farnsworth were shot and killed.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsequently, Linda’s remains were finally identified, and police were able to make an arrest years later. The case took a dark turn as it was revealed that one person was responsible for all three homicides.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The reason behind Linda’s death&nbsp;</h2><p>Linda Watson’s story is one of heartbreak and tragedy. Her mother, Marilyn Cox, last seen her on August 20, 2000, after attending church and having lunch together.&nbsp;</p><p>The following day, on August 21, a repairman found evidence of a struggle inside Linda’s home, including a broken cup and blood stains.</p><p>&nbsp;Linda and her ex-husband, David Watson, were embroiled in a bitter custody battle over their daughter, Jordynn.</p><p>&nbsp;Linda had reportedly planned to get a restraining order against David, who was a fire department captain at the time.</p><p>Marilyn also became involved in a legal dispute over visitation rights with David and his then-second wife, Rosemary.</p><p>Tragically, Marilyn and her friend Renee Farnsworth were shot and killed just after Marilyn’s first unsupervised visit with Jordynn on May 7, 2003.</p><p>They had just dropped off the young girl when the shooting occurred. It’s worth noting that</p><p>Marilyn had appointed her lawyer to submit a restraining order against David on the same day but skipped the appointment.</p><p>For years, Marilyn tried to find her daughter and made numerous television appearances, but her efforts were in vain.&nbsp;</p><p>She also fought for the visiting rights of her granddaughters in a two-year legal battle.&nbsp;</p><p>In October 2003, Linda’s skeletal remains were discovered in the desert west of Tucson, along with the bodies of illegal immigrants.</p><p>The body had completely deteriorated, and it was only through DNA evidence that authorities were able to identify the remains as Linda’s in 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;The case took a perverse turn as it developed into a triple homicide connected to David Watson, who was eventually arrested and convicted for the murders of Linda, Marilyn, and Renee.</p><p>Linda’s story is a tragic one, highlighting the dangers and consequences of domestic disputes and custody battles.</p><p>&nbsp;It’s a sobering reminder of the need for proper legal protections and support systems for victims of domestic violence and their families.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Killed Linda? Her husband Watson?&nbsp;</h2><p>After three people were found dead, authorities conducted an extensive investigation and ultimately suspected Linda’s father, David Watson, of their murders.</p><p>&nbsp;Investigators believed that David had killed them due to a custody dispute over Jordynn. On August 25, 2015, the Sheriff’s department arrested David Watson in connection with the triple homicide after completing their investigation.</p><p>&nbsp;David was considered the primary suspect in the case involving Linda Watson, Marilyn Cox, and Renee Farnsworth.</p><p>On April 17, 2017, David Watson was found guilty and sentenced to 66 years in prison for his involvement in the triple homicide. He was given a 16-year sentence and two life sentences of 25 years each.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAx55kpaGema5uw8CtqqimXaLCs7DEq2ScmaOaeqJ5y6impGWRqXq1tMRmq6uZl56wbsDRoqelnV2dvK61wqKbnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
