That’s a difficult position to put myself into when I don’t need to.”</p><p>The Wire alum continued, “James Bond is a hugely coveted, iconic, beloved character that takes audiences on this massive escapism journey. Of course, if someone said to me, ‘Do you want to play James Bond?,’ I’d be like, ‘Yeah!’ That’s fascinating to me. But it’s not something I’ve expressed, like, ‘Yeah, I wanna be the black James Bond.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though the jury is still out on who will serve as the next Bond, fans have already met the next 007.
