The two don't get along at all and it seems like anytime&nbsp;they were on camera together,&nbsp;they were screaming or walking out on one another. It seems like it would take quite a lot for the mother and daughter to repair their relationship as it&nbsp;appears really broken. Farrah was fired from&nbsp;Teen Mom&nbsp;back in 2017 and so fans haven't seen her on their TV screens in quite a while.</p><p>Let's take a look at everything that has happened between the reality star and her mother.</p><h2 id=farrah-s-mental-health>Farrah's Mental Health</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans worry about Farrah as a mother&nbsp;</a>and as it turns out, her own mom worries about her as well.</p><p>Debra has said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Farrah has mental health problems</a>. According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, Debra said about Farrah back in 2018, "If you have Borderline Personality Disorder, if you have narcissism, any of these kinds of things, they’re all highly treatable.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Teen Mom 2’ Star Kailyn Lowry Will Be Making Sure Baby #5 Is A Girl</a></span></p><h2 id=the-2010-situation>The 2010 Situation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Farrah-Abraham.jpg><p>Fans of&nbsp;Teen Mom&nbsp;will recall that in 2010, Farrah says that Debra physically hurt her, according to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet. The two had a big fight and the cops got involved, leading to Debra's arrest.&nbsp; It seems that the bad blood between these two goes back to this time back in 2010, and it's hard for Farrah to move on from it, understandably.</p><p>According to&nbsp;In Touch Weekly, Farrah says that her mom and dad hurt her when she was growing up, and she has talked about this quite a lot. Debra keeps saying that it didn't happen. Debra explained her side of the story and it's fair to say that it didn't sound very supportive. She said, "look at all the millions of people out there who suffered, they don’t blame the world for it. They have to grow up. It’s time to grow up and get over it!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it turns out that Debra says that her daughter hurt her as well, so there seems to be quite a lot to this story.&nbsp;In Touch Weekly&nbsp;notes that when Debra wrote a memoir called&nbsp;Vapor: A True Story of How I Fell Victim To Catfishing,&nbsp;she talked about Farrah physically harming her. She wrote, "After all of this, she had quietly gone upstairs to call the police and turn me in."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Much Teen Mom’s Chelsea Houska Is Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-mother-daughter-relationship>The Mother/Daughter Relationship</h2><p>It's fair to say that Debra and Farrah don't have a very peaceful or happy mother/daughter relationship. In 2018, Farrah was accused of assaulting a security guard&nbsp;and that led to an arrest. According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, when Debra was asked about it, she said,&nbsp;“It was horrifying. I was hysterical because first of all, I worry for my daughter’s safety, and then I worry for my granddaughter’s safety."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debra continued that she never got in touch with Farrah during this time. She said, "I’ve been very concerned for the health and safety of Sophia because of Farrah’s behavior. TMZ calls me up, ‘Hey Debra, Farrah is arrested.’" She shared, "That’s not good for Sophia to be around."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Farrah-Abraham-Debra-Danielson.jpg><p>Ultimately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Debra is worried about Sophia</a> and this seems to be where the heart of the issue lies.&nbsp;It doesn't sound like Debra is happy that her daughter has become so famous and that this has affected her lifestyle.</p><p>Debra said about Sophia, "She needs to be with her family, not about strangers and volatility and her mother being arrested. It’s very disgusting. She needs to go to school… She needs to not be dragged on a party all over the world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Meaww.com, Farrah felt that her mom was "negative" when talking to the media about the arrest, and she thinks that her mom should definitely have gotten in touch.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Teen Mom’: Why Jenelle Evans Continues To Confuse Fans</a></span></p><p>Farrah and Debra haven't had an easy time of things, and it definitely doesn't sound like it would be simple for them to repair their fractured bond. It's a "she said/she said" kind of situation as they both feel that the other person has done them wrong, and it's hard to know how they could move forward.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Teen Mom’ Reddit Fans Think Chelsea Houska is Quiet Because She’s Hiding Her Pregnancy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnp2eYrqwuYyhnKudo2LEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjJucra%2BVmrtussCrqZqgXZavs63HmqRmmZ6Zeqmx0WakqKVf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
