She had a memorable cameo during season 2, and as it turns out, the creators didn't forget about her contributions, as she was brought back to the show years later. In the following, we'll take a look back at her contributions to the series, and <a href=#>how she impacted The Big Bang Theory behind the scenes as well with a certain song</a>. In addition, we're going to reveal why the show's creators decided to bring her back in the first place. Let's get started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=riki-lindhome-also-did-work-on-the-big-bang-theory-alongside-kate-micucci-behind-the-scenes>Riki Lindhome Also Did Work On The Big Bang Theory Alongside Kate Micucci Behind The Scenes</h2><p>Little do fans know, Riki Lindhome made a major contribution behind the scenes on The Big Bang Theory, alongside Kate Micucci. The actress created Howard's song to Bernadette, a process both stars enjoyed.</p><p><a href=#>Kate Micucci discussed the experience</a>, "Steve Molaro called us. It seemed our music/comedic sensibility lined up with the show. Also, both Riki and I are huge fans of the show and have both been on it, so we were excited to write a song that was funny but also had a lot of heart."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Big Bang Theory Didn't Want To Show Howard And Bernadette's Kids, But Why Did The Show Change Their Mind?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Riki would also discuss the process alongside Composer, stating that it was a quick turnaround between giving the song to the show, and the scene getting shot.</p><p>"We handed it in on a Friday and then by the next Friday, they’d filmed it live. There was more instant gratification watching the cast sing it. As Riki said, they can’t change it after they’ve shot it."</p><p>It was quite the experience for the duo, however, both would thrive on-screen as well with the show. Lindhome in particular made her debut in season 2, and would be brought back years later.</p><h2 id=the-big-bang-theory-creators-needed-to-give-sheldon-a-challenge-when-amy-went-away>The Big Bang Theory Creators Needed To Give Sheldon A Challenge When Amy Went Away</h2><p>There were big plans for the season 10 finale. Among the notable talking points at the time, included the return of Ramona Nowitzki, once again, attached to Sheldon. <a href=#>Steve Molaro discussed the decision and why the character made her return.</a> According to the showrunner, a major reason was to see how Sheldon would fend on his own, without Amy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"With Amy away for a few months, we liked the idea that Sheldon was essentially on his own for the first time as far as what we've seen on Big Bang Theory, living in an apartment by himself, his girlfriend who he's very attached to is now far away, and we wanted to explore what that would mean for his character."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Reason The Big Bang Theory Creators Changed Their Minds About Penny Having Kids</a></span></p><p>A major part of this breakdown, would be testing Sheldon with another woman. The first name considered among creators, was none other than Riki Lindhome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"One of the things we thought could be interesting based on that was what would happen if another woman came along while Amy was gone and what would that do to Sheldon as well as his group of friends," the showrunner tells TV Guide.</p><h2 id=riki-lindhome-was-a-favorite-by-the-creators-since-her-season-2-cameo>Riki Lindhome Was A Favorite By The Creators Since Her Season 2 Cameo</h2><p>Sure, Lindhome fit perfectly into the storyline, however, she was a big favorite behind the scenes, since her work in season 2. The decision to have Riki return was an easy one for the creators.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And then once we had that thought, what if another woman comes sniffing around after Sheldon, the next question was who would that woman be? And we had always loved when Riki played Ramona in Season 2, so we quickly called her to see if she was available."</p><p>Thankfully for the show, she was indeed available and after that, things fell quickly into place.</p><p>"She was, and it happened very quickly after that. Everything fell into place. We love her."</p><p>Riki's return was quite the moment and one that made things interesting for Sheldon's love life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbWmecGinmaakaO0bsDHnqarsV2Yv6at06iprGWSp7y2s8etZKuhm556rbXNnZ%2BopZVir6Kvymg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
