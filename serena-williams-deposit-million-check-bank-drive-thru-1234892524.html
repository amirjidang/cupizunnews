I wanted to be the best. I wanted to win,” she said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Further recalling her lack of concern for money back then, she added, “So my tax guy, he would be like, ‘You didn’t get your money?’ and I’d be like, ‘Oh, I didn’t get that one in Zurich,’ ‘Oh, I forgot that one in Moscow’… I was just playing to win, and if I didn’t win, I wasn’t thinking. I was just so angry, that I wanted to find a way to get better and win the next time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Williams admitted that her first million dollar check was one of her biggest lessons learned.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 42-year-old’s recollection comes after she sort of <a href=#>hinted at returning to tennis</a> on social media. In May 21, Williams cryptically wrote, “I’m ready to hit some balls again,” on X, causing fans to raise eyebrows.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The viral message came two years after she revealed that she was “evolving” from tennis, rather than retiring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m ready to hit some balls again</p>— Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 21, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In an as-told-to with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vogue</a>, Williams expressed that she wanted to focus on other endeavors in her personal life like family and her&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>venture capital firm</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m evolving away from tennis, toward&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234824111>other things that are important to me</a>,” she shared at the time. “I have to focus on being a mom, my spiritual goals, and finally discovering a different, but just exciting Serena. I’m gonna relish these next few weeks.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since her “evolvement,” Williams has done all that she said she would and more, including&nbsp;<a href=#>welcoming her second daughter&nbsp;</a>with her husband and launching her own makeup line called Wyn Beauty.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, this Thursday (July 11) Williams will be hosting the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234889327>2024 ESPY Awards.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6iys7HNmmSwoZyhtqK50mabnqifqLa1ecyio6Whn6N6pLTEnKJmmpGjuG6w0aKtnmWknb%2B2eZBram1waWeCc4CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
