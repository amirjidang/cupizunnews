An earlier version of BO2 made $1 billion in &nbsp;16 days.&nbsp; It took <a title="James Cameron Net Worth" href=#>James Cameron</a>’s blockbuster <i>Avatar</i> 17 days to hit that mark.</p><p>Hollywood and its stars have a history with video games.&nbsp; At the dawn of the gaming era, Walt Disney released the massively successful <i>Tron </i>(1982) which was a sci-fi movie about characters &nbsp;lost in a sinister gaming universe where death and destruction were the order of the day.&nbsp; These days, stars such as <a title="Liam Neeson Net Worth" href=#>Liam Neeson</a>, <a title="Snoop Lion Net Worth (Snoop Dogg)" href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>, <a title="Christina Aguilera Net Worth" href=#>Christina Aguilera</a>, <a title="Cameron Diaz Net Worth" href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> and <a title="Jon Bon Jovi Net Worth" href=#>Jon Bon Jovi</a> are appearing in video games as playable characters (and not, it must be said, always winning the day).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’ve come a long way from the first appearance of Mario (Donkey Kong) and the introduction of the Game Boy in the 1980’s.&nbsp; By the 1990’s, the gaming world had moved into home-based gaming consoles and the turn of the Millineum saw the first Xbox and the revolution of Wii with its motion sensitive action games.&nbsp; And now with the MMO, the gaming world has gone online and stars and “normal” people alike have taken to the virtual universe of Massive Multiplayer Online games.&nbsp; You never know (or realize) when <a title="Mila Kunis Net Worth" href=#>Mila Kunis</a>, <a title="Megan Fox Net Worth" href=#>Megan Fox</a> or Snoop Dogg might be trying to blow your head off.&nbsp; And don’t think they won’t try.</p><p>And many of the stars love gaming.&nbsp; Established stars like Snoop Dogg, <a title="Ice T Net Worth" href=#>Ice-T</a> and <a title="Robin Williams Net Worth" href=#>Robin Williams </a>are keen gamers and <a title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth" href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> is involved in the development and production end of video games.&nbsp; Younger stars such as Mila Kunis and Megan Fox are addicted, as are comedians Mary McCarthy, <a title="Dave Chappelle Net Worth" href=#>Dave Chappelle</a> and <a title="Seth Rogen Net Worth" href=#>Seth Rogen</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hunks such as <a title="Daniel Craig Net Worth" href=#>Daniel Craig</a> and <a title="Vin Diesel Net Worth" href=#>Vin Diesel</a> have publicly voiced their enthusiasm for video games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The clear top three games in star land are <i>World of Warcraft</i> (self evident what that one is about), <i>Call of Duty </i>that began with World War II war games and has currently moved into more Futuristic scenarios, and <i>Halo</i>, a sci-fi futuristic humans versus evil aliens battle for survival.</p><p>So, let’s take a look at the stars who love to play and the games they swear by:</p><h2 id=10-mila-kunis><strong>10.
