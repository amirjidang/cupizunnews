He made his initial fame as a former WWE wrestler and champion back in 1996. He became known for arching his right eyebrow and coining the phrase, "Can you smell what The Rock is cookin!" Johnson was at the top of his game in the wrestling entertainment business and he didn't stop there.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Rock Dwayne Johnson Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Johnson after retiring from the WWE skyrocketed to be one of the top movie stars in the industry, as well as a producer. He also happens to be humble, determined, a motivator and the generator of some of the most hilarious memes on the internet.</p><h2 id=rock-paper-scissors>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2><p>Childhood was all about playing games to pass the time in the schoolyard or in between classes. Screaming "Rock, Papers, Scissors Shoot!" was a particular favorite. It can be used to settle fights, bets or decide who has to do the embarrassing prank.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dwayne Johnson is also referred to as 'The Rock'. His nickname&nbsp;has become the focal point of many memes including this one. Johnson is seen portraying 'The Rock', paper and scissors hand gestures. There's no reason to lie and say you didn't have a good chuckle at this one.</p><h2 id=the-rock-s-evolution>The Rock's Evolution</h2><p>Johnson has always been a big guy. He stands at a whopping six feet and five inches tall. Over the years, Johnson has advocated for living a healthy and active life. He has been popular on social media for documenting his early morning and late-night workouts at hours most people would be asleep. Johnson also does heavy set reps of various workouts with sweat dripping everywhere.</p><p>Because of <a href=#>his dedication to the gym</a>, his body has grown significantly. Many fans have been shocked seeing the body size&nbsp;comparisons from when he was a teenager to the body he has now. This meme shows the evolution of Johnson's body and what it could look like in the near future.</p><h2 id=maui-dresses-up-as-the-rock>Maui Dresses Up As The Rock</h2><p>Back in 2014, Johnson shared a throwback photo to his younger days that caught everyone's attention. It's not everyday fans get a photo of Johnson wearing a black turtleneck with some light blue jeans. What set fans reeling were the accessories. There's nothing better than a leather fanny pack and silver chain jewelry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnson played the role of Maui in the 2014 Disney film Moana.&nbsp;The resemblance between Maui and Johnson is impeccable. Social media couldn't help poking some fun at the actor and the character in a new meme.</p><h2 id=the-same-look>The Same Look</h2><p>For his many roles, Johnson hasn't had to physically alter his appearance. He did gain more muscle for his role in Pain and Gain in 2013. Besides body mass, he has relatively stayed the same when playing his roles. His new role in the franchise films <a href=#>Jumanji&nbsp;</a>allowed for some new memes to be created.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Rock: 10 Crazy Expensive Things Dwayne Johnson Has Bought</a></span></p><p>The meme shows three screenshots from the films. At first glance, they all look the same. If you didn't know any better, you would think they're all from the same movie. Fans on social media even had to do a double-take.</p><h2 id=his-hair-loss>His Hair Loss</h2><p>Back during his days in WWE, Johnson&nbsp;did adorn some hair and it continued for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">number of films</a> like Tooth Fairy and Game Plan.&nbsp;It's hard to imagine the rock with hair, but it did happen once upon a time. This was during a time when he was significantly smaller in body size.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As he grew in muscle size, he seems to have lost his hair.&nbsp;For many men, at some point it seems easier to let it all go and be worry-free. Everything has its side effects and the internet decided to have&nbsp;some fun.</p><h2 id=can-you-smell-that>Can You Smell That</h2><p>When people automatically think of The Rock, they don't think about Dwayne Johnson the actor. Instead, they think about the hotshot, conceited and over the top wrestling persona he adopted in the ring. Every wrestling fan at some point tried to imitate his arched eyebrow.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson Reclaims Top Celebrity Social Media Ranking</a></span></p><p>With a microphone in hand, he would say the phrase, "Can you smell what The Rock is cookin!" in the most dramatic way possible. The crowd would go nuts and say the phrase along with him. The phrase soon became a meme along with the face he makes when he inhales.</p><h2 id=the-cufflink-pose>The Cufflink&nbsp;Pose</h2><p>Dwayne Johnson is an avid social media user and thinks it's a great way to promote and keep in touch with fans. He's not shy to share photos and videos of his press days, family and messages to his beloved fans. There seems to be a consistent theme when he's dressed up in a nice suit and the internet&nbsp;noticed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans noticed Johnson always striking the same pose. A pose that has since been mocked and imitated by many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">men on social media</a>. The obligatory hand to the cufflink pretending to&nbsp;button it up. It seems as though Johnson will never finish cuffing his cufflink.</p><h2 id=self-love>Self Love</h2><p>A majority of Dwayne Johnson memes on the internet have something to do with the use of his ring name 'The Rock'. This one is no different, but it's a good one and holds an important message.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 12 Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson On Screen Moments</a></span></p><p>Self-love is a crucial&nbsp;way of thinking when it&nbsp;comes to self-esteem and living a happy life. The Rock is here to remind everyone of that. The meme has The Rock holding a giant rock with "Love Yourself" along the bottom. The meme is a funny double innuendo that makes anyone let out a laugh.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-s-twin>Dwayne Johnson's Twin</h2><p>There was a point in time when fans of Dwayne Johnson believed he had a twin brother. Dwayne Johnson the actor was remarkably different from Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and the internet made it seem as if they&nbsp;were two separate people. The joke caught on and had people googling whether or not it was true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sooner or later various memes were created about the joke. The memes range from The Rock being Johnson's stunt double to photoshopping two pictures of Johnson in the same frame. It's quite a convincing meme at first glance.</p><h2 id=high-quality-dwayne-johnson>High-Quality Dwayne Johnson</h2><p>In the age of film and television, the highest resolution&nbsp;is the best quality. The smallest hint of a blurry picture is unacceptable. It was a good opportunity to make a meme out of the subject using Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.</p><p>Again Johnson's nickname becomes the focal point of humor and this one gets a good laugh. The lowest resolution of 144p gives a blurry undefined image of The Rock. The higher the resolution the better the details get. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson really comes into focus by 4k resolution.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Reason We Want Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson To Be Our BFF</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlKyuurrEZqGooJ6ovK95zJ6knqtdnbatrdGipq6rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
