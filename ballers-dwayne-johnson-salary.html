He's grown to insane levels of fame thanks to his well-rounded talents in acting, singing, and physical feats that are pretty much insane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's known for taking his gym on the road with him, being super adorable with his two toddlers with wife Lauren Hashian (he also has a now-grown daughter with his ex), and posting up on Instagram for his 100 million+ followers.</p><p>Honestly, he's got his public persona locked in and it's a total money maker. So is it really surprising that 'Ballers' pays a crazy amount of money per episode to have him on the cast?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Much Dwayne Johnson Was Paid For 'Moana'</a></span></p><p>The show 'Ballers' was a comedy that lasted five seasons on HBO. Dwayne himself said on IG that the show was the highest-rated comedy series on HBO. Of course, as one of the show's executive producers, maybe Johnson has to say that. Mark Wahlberg is also credited as an exec on the show, along with a handful of others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And though its trajectory didn't last, it's true that fans were thrilled with the show's run. The 47-episode series was right up Johnson's alley both in terms of the physicality of it (he played a former NFL player) and the comedy.</p><p>And according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a>, Dwayne made a staggering $700,000 per episode for appearing on 'Ballers.' HBO likely knew they'd have to pay out to attract Johnson, whose net worth totals around $280 million already.</p><p>That's thanks to Dwayne's success in nearly every type of entertainment avenue, from wrestling with the WWE to voicing animated characters on kids' movies. Throughout his career, Dwayne's been known for everything from being a big bad action hero to singing catchy tunes as an animated demigod, and fans can't get enough.</p><p>Further,&nbsp;Sportskeeda confirms that Dwayne earns 15 percent of the proceeds for the franchises he's in. That means he gets a cut of royalties from 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">millions from 'Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw,'</a> and payoffs from countless other blockbusters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides his film success, The Rock has also garnered plenty of endorsement deals. He has collaborated with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Under Armour</a> and created his own shoe line, Project Rock. The line is called the Chase Greatness Collection, and Dwayne is rocking it hard.</p><p>But he's also released his own tequila brand (Teremana Tequila), which he's also been flaunting all over social media. That's not even the entire list of his accomplishments, though: now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a new show called 'Young Rock' will retell Dwayne's life story</a>.</p><p>And TBH, fans are stoked.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Much Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Makes Per Sponsored Post On Instagram</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmqScmr%2B0ecOwmLKmlWK3sLTNrKanZaOWuaK%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
