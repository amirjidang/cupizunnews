The company was established by the <b>German Labour Front</b> under the leadership of <b>Adolf Hitler</b>, with the goal of creating an affordable car for the German population.</p><p>The project, known as the <b>People’s Car project</b>, was headed by <b>Ferdinand Porsche</b>, a highly accomplished automotive engineer. Together, they aimed to develop a low-priced vehicle that would be accessible to the average citizen. The result was the creation of the first prototype, called the <b>KdF-Wagen</b>, in the late 1930s.</p><p>However, the outbreak of World War II disrupted production, and the Volkswagen factory shifted its focus to manufacturing military vehicles. It wasn’t until after the war that Volkswagen was able to resume car production and expand its reach globally.</p><p>Despite the challenges faced during its early years, Volkswagen quickly gained popularity and established itself as a leading automotive brand. The company’s commitment to <b>innovation</b> and quality propelled it to become a trusted name in the industry.</p><p>In 1949, <b>Volkswagenwerk GmbH</b> was founded, marking a significant milestone in Volkswagen’s history. This new company took over the operations and assets of the original Volkswagen factory, setting the stage for future growth and expansion.</p><p>Today, Volkswagen continues to be a global powerhouse in the automotive industry, renowned for its iconic vehicles and cutting-edge technologies.</p><table><tr><th>Key Events</th><th>Year</th></tr><tr><td>Volkswagen’s founding by the German Labour Front</td><td>1937</td></tr><tr><td>Development of the <b>KdF-Wagen</b> prototype</td><td>Late 1930s</td></tr><tr><td>Shift to manufacturing military vehicles during World War II</td><td>1939-1945</td></tr><tr><td>Resumption of car production after the war</td><td>1945</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation of <b>Volkswagenwerk GmbH</b></td><td>1949</td></tr></table><h2>Volkswagen’s Post-War Revival and Expansion</h2><p>After World War II, the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg, Germany, came under the control of the British Army. <b>British Army officer Ivan Hirst</b> played a crucial role in the revival of Volkswagen, helping stabilize the factory and reestablish production. Initially, the focus was on repairing British Army vehicles, but in 1945, a vital order for 20,000 cars from the British Army provided a significant boost to Volkswagen’s post-war recovery.</p><p>The iconic <b>Beetle</b>, with its distinctive round shape and air-cooled rear engine, became Volkswagen’s flagship model and gained popularity worldwide. The Beetle’s affordability, reliability, and charming design made it a beloved car for millions of people. The <b>Beetle</b> quickly became a symbol of the “economic miracle” in 1950s Germany and achieved remarkable success both domestically and internationally.</p><p>In the 1970s, Volkswagen introduced the <b>Golf</b>, a compact hatchback that would go on to become a bestseller and solidify Volkswagen’s position as a leading global automaker.
