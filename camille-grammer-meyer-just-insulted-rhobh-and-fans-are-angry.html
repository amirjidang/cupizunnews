Let's take a look at what she said.</p><h2 id=what-camille-said>What Camille Said</h2><p>Fans have been invested in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">learning about Erika and Tom Girardi's divorce</a>, and it seems like her castmates, both current and former, should support her during this time. Camille had something to say about her, though, and</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille tweeted about Erika's mascara</a>,&nbsp;and Lisa Rinna didn't like that at all.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Page Six, Camille tweeted,&nbsp;“We filmed in the Bahamas season 9 and we were all swimming in the water. I don’t remember seeing EJ’s mascara run after swimming underwater. Just saying."</p><p>Lisa Rinna tweeted,&nbsp;“Oh someone needs some attention ok sweetie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others have mentioned Erika's mascara, though, so it wasn't just Camille who felt that she should say something.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Page Six, while some fans thought Camille was right for saying that Erika's mascara wasn't really running, others felt that the&nbsp;reality star was being mean. One fan tweeted, "If you haven’t anything nice to say don’t say anything." Another said,&nbsp;“You need to really let this show go. I’m feeling really sorry for you at this point."</p><p>Kim Archie, who used to work for Tom Girardi, went on the podcast "Juicy Scoop" and shared that she didn't know why Erika wasn't wearing waterproof mascara. She said,&nbsp;“There’s been waterproof mascara since 1938 — before we were all born — so I’m sure she could get waterproof mascara.&nbsp;She likes big sunglasses. There are scenes that somebody posted where she’s inside with sunglasses. So she’s sitting in bright sunlight with non-waterproof mascara, you know, just sobbing," according to&nbsp;Us Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather Dubrow Said She Isn’t Hired As An Actress Anymore, Here’s Why</a></span></p><h2 id=fake-rhobh-scenes>Fake 'RHOBH' Scenes?</h2><p>People are always wondering if some scenes are fake, and this isn't the first time that someone has said this about&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><p>According to&nbsp;TV Shows Ace, Lisa Rinna was talking to her daughter Amelia in a scene, and since Amelia had two totally different hats on, people wondered if that meant that it wasn't real. Some fans began tweeting about it and said that the scene could have been shot more than once.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People also thought that Brandi Glanville was talking about her alleged relationship with Denise Richards so she could return to the reality series. Brandi&nbsp;said "If I was just doing it to make a splash, why would I not have done it last season?" according to&nbsp;Us Weekly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The ‘RHOBH’ Moment Fans Think Went Too Far</a></span></p><h2 id=camille-s-other-comments>Camille's Other&nbsp;Comments</h2><p>Camille's comments about Erika's crying and mascara aren't the first time that she has said something that is super bold.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille insulted Lisa Vanderpump's teeth</a> and then said that she was sorry. According to&nbsp;Us Weekly, Camille said,&nbsp;“Before Lisa Vanderpump got her teeth redone, I had an issue with the … I had such an issue with the gums. I was like, ‘Honey, you need new caps. Your gum line is receding.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Camille tweeted that she felt bad about what she said: "I previewed this weeks episode and it reinforces the fact that I shouldn’t have a cocktail. Stupid things I say when tipsy. “I am very disappointed in my distasteful comments about Lisa. “It was a joke but it was in very poor taste. I’m so sorry @LisaVanderpump.”</p><p>Camille has also spoken out against the cast of&nbsp;RHOBH.&nbsp;People&nbsp;reported that she tweeted about the reunion back in 2019 and while she had kind words about Lisa Vanderpump, she didn't have nice things to say about everyone else. Camille tweeted,&nbsp;“The ladies at the reunion lack compassion. LVP is a class act. She called me last night to see how I was doing. Class vs trash.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About ‘RHOBH’ Star Kyle Richards’s Days As A Child Star</a></span></p><p>Fans recall that when Camille was on the first few seasons of the reality show, she didn't hold any words back, and the same thing has&nbsp;been true every time she has come back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, Camille said she was&nbsp;"disappointed" that she wasn't a huge part of the tenth season of the show, as she figured that she would be.
