They suggested that he had not committed the murders as part of a wider plan, but as part of a drug deal gone wrong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tooley’s Reaction to the Verdict</h2><p>Tooley himself showed little emotion after hearing the guilty verdict. Moments before the verdict was read out, he had winked and smiled at his family members in the audience.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as Judge Wittmayer read out the verdict, he appeared to glance down.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Trial Continues</h2><p>As the jury reconvenes, they will decide what form of punishment to impose on Tooley. With the possibility of the death penalty on the table, the decision is a weighty one.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Tooley remains in custody, awaiting his fate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>James Charles Tooley has been found guilty of the aggravated murders of two oxycodone dealers in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>The verdict was given by a Multnomah County Jury following 2.5 weeks of trial and three days of deliberation.&nbsp;</p><p>Tooley’s defense team claimed that he was not trying to orchestrate a murder-for-hire plot from jail.
