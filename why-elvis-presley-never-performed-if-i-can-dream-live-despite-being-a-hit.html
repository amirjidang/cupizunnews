The entertainer, who once was the face of the rock 'n' roll movement, was tied down to film contracts requiring him to star in movies he was not passionate about. Presley had<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> not performed live </a>since 1961, according to the Elvis History Blog.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/elvis-presley-riley-keough.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Riley Keough Never Met Elvis Presley, But She Did Inherit His Musical Talent</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Riley Keough says she's been inspired by her grandfather's talent, but that music runs in Elvis Presley's family.</span><p>Presley wanted to prove to himself and the world that he was still musically relevant. He also missed the thrill of performing live for fans. For the first time in years, Presley was signed to a project he was actually excited about, according to Fox News. Singer Presents... Elvis, now affectionately known as the '68 Comeback Special, was destined to change Presley's career, and it did.</p><p><strong>Presley, who usually refrained from making public political comments,</strong> was among millions of Americans who were emotionally affected by the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy in 1968. While Presley never made his political affiliations known, he understood America was in a vulnerable position and was experiencing great loss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/elvis-loving-you-vinyl-deposit.jpg><p>He also recognized that this evil must stop. Presley was a proud American and a spiritual man. With this in mind, he decided to perform a rare song that expressed his feelings. <strong>"If I Can Dream" was hauntingly beautiful and spoke of an optimistic future.</strong></p><p>Appearing in a white suit representing purity, Presley stood in front of massive red letters spelling out his name as he gave one of the most passionate and emotional performances of his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/why-did-elvis-presley-never-perform-_if-i-can-dream_-live-despite-being-a-hit-among-fans_-dront-deposit-back-elvis-presley_youtube-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to LibQuotes, when Presley first heard "If I Can Dream", he reportedly proclaimed:</p><p>"I'm not going to sing another song I don't believe in. I'm never going to make another picture I don't believe in."</p><p>Presley knew that "If I Can Dream" could be his contribution to an ongoing discussion about America's state. Furthermore, he knew it could resonate with his audience. "If I Can Dream" was commercially and critically acclaimed and showed a concerned Presley sharing his heart with the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/elvis-graceland-sign-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Presley<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> only performed "If I Can Dream" on the '68 Comeback Special</a>, and never again. While his reasoning for doing so cannot be confirmed, fans believe he refused to perform the song live for one of two reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>The song was too much of an emotional experience for him, and he did not want to sing it again</strong></li><li><strong>He later felt it was too political in nature and did not want to constantly make a statement at his concerts</strong></li></ul><p>Both reasons have merit. Presley rarely chose to record songs that had political meaning and even refused to discuss his political beliefs in interviews. In one interview in particular, a young woman asked Presley, who once served in the military himself, what he thought about protesters and draft dodgers in Vietnam. He replied:</p><p>"I'd just...keep my own personal views about that to myself. Cause I'm just an entertainer and I'd rather not say."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides "If I Can Dream", one of the few songs Presley recorded that had some political significance was "In the Ghetto" in 1969. Presley wanted to be a universal entertainer and not incorporate his personal beliefs into his professional career unless he felt he had to. He could have very well felt later that "If I Can Dream" would not be a good song to perform in concert.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/elvis-presley-singing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Elvis Wasn't Originally Buried At Graceland, But A Strange Crime Changed Everything</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>45 years after the death of Elvis, his burial site is still visited by over 600,000 visitors annually. But it’s not where he was first buried.</span><p>Presley also might have experienced such a strong emotional connection to "If I Can Dream" that it was difficult for him to perform again. The performance he gave on the '68 Comeback Special was so heartfelt, that maybe he did not want to have to relive it. When he heard the song for the first time, it struck such a cord with him that he vowed to only work on projects he felt passionate about. In ways, the song changed him. Not only did it allow him to make a statement about America during its era, but reminded Presley of the performer he was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If I Can Dream" was not the only song Presley chose not to perform live. He<a href=# rel=nofollow> later removed one of his biggest hits</a>, "Suspicious Minds", from set lists after growing tired of the song.</p><h2 id=what-is-quot-if-i-can-dream-quot-39-s-legacy>What Is "If I Can Dream"'s Legacy?</h2><p>No matter why Elvis Presley ultimately chose to never perform "If I Can Dream" again, the song has had a profound and lasting impact. Righfully, it is regarded as one of his greatest works.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/elvis-statue-kobe-japan-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If I Can Dream" was very much a song of its era, however, it holds a timeless message that is still applicable today. The song, which took inspiration from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have A Dream" speech, invites listeners to dream of a world where individuals live in peace and harmony. "If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand", such lyrics are nothing shorter than profound. Presley knew this and he sang them with every ounce of his being.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/lisa-marie-presley-s-funeral-was-eerily-similar-to-her-dad-elvis-presley-s.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley's Funeral Was Eerily Similar To Her Dad, Elvis Presley's</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lisa Marie Presley's tragic death was similar to that of her father Elvis Presley, but their funerals were also almost identical.</span><p>Elvis fans, young and old, still take great solace in the beauty of "If I Can Dream." Even non-fans have embraced the song and Presley's epic performance. Presley, who passed away on August 16, 1977, continues to inspire individuals with a meaningful dream more than 45 years after his passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmrm3tdJmp6udo6GyunnNnq2eql2lsrOyzquknpxdnrNutYycmKdllKeyormMpaCvnV2ZsrS8yK2cZpqVnruoecBmn6KsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
