The couple has been photographed together on multiple occasions in recent months, but it’s not clear how long they’ve been together. For now, neither Lana nor Evan have commented on their rumored engagement.</p><p>Lana has historically been private about her personal life, and rarely opens up about her romantic relationships. The singer previously dated Scottish musician Barrie-James O’Neill from 2012 to 2014, before being linked to Francesco Carrozzini briefly until 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Lana has been romantically connected to rapper G-Eazy, and most recently to police officer and Live PD analyst Sean “Sticks” Larkin. He confirmed their split in 2020, citing conflicting schedules.</p><p>" <a href=#>Right now, we're just friends</a> ," Sean said at the time. "We still talk and whatnot, we just have busy schedules right now."</p><p>Only a few weeks ago, Lana released her 9th studio album Ocean Boulevard, which she announced in December 2022 on Sean’s birthday.</p><p>She took another jab at her ex when she arranged the only billboard promoting her album to go up in his hometown. "There's only one [billboard] and it's in Tulsa," Lana said on her private Instagram account, before adding in the comments, "It's. Personal."</p><p>She was linked to musicians Clayton Johnson and Jack Donoghue before she went public with her current relationship with Evan Winkier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Travis Scott Pays Big To Avoid Lawsuit After Nightclub Assault</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Jessica Flinn</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8uapZpllJq5br7EsmSgnaSoeqa6xpqenpxdrLa1tIxsZ2loYGV6pbXApqannF2ntq%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
