However, she probably wishes she did. It’s a funnier and happier story than her actual tattoo.

Once she was certain her marriage was over and the paperwork was filed, Kaley had to get rid of the last reminder of their relationship: her tattoo. Instead of getting the roman numerals lasered off, she opted to get another tattoo to cover it up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-a-moth>Why A Moth?</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Ellen,</a> Kaley said, “The (wedding) tattoo was a mistake. I had to cover it, I had to cover it with the wings, which I think it turned out okay.” Lucky for us, Ellen asked the question we were all thinking. “People do butterflies but why a moth? What’s the significance?” It turns out there wasn’t one. The moth with its giant wings could cover up the roman numerals. She wanted the tattoo gone and replaced it with whatever would do the job. She picked the moth at the tattoo parlor. We are guessing the tattoo artist told her the options to cover it up and that’s the one she chose.</p><h2 id=why-did-kaley-decide-to-cover-up-her-tattoo-instead-of-getting-it-removed>Why Did Kaley Decide To Cover Up Her Tattoo Instead Of Getting It Removed?</h2><p>Most celebrities select a laser treatment to get rid of their relationship tattoos; the pricier option, but clearly, they can afford it. It’s also extremely painful, most claim the pain is even worse than getting the tattoo. It also takes&nbsp;multiple treatments to fully remove the tattoo. Depending on the size and the color of the ink it could&nbsp;take months or&nbsp;years for the removal.</p><p>Mark Walberg thought it would only take three to four treatments to get all of his nine tattoos removed. He ended up needing seven years of treatment and brought his children to attend the removal sessions with him. There's nothing like seeing their dad cry in pain to teach them a lesson of getting a tattoo on spring break.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tallulah Willis Removes A Tattoo Just As The Face Tattoo Trend Dies Down</a></span></p><h2 id=regenerative-skin-treatment>Regenerative Skin Treatment</h2><p>Another option is called regenerative skin treatment; essentially growing new skin to replace the tattooed one. The doctors take a sample of the skin, then replicate the cells, and when the skin is&nbsp;large enough to cover the tattoo, they sew it on.</p><p>It’s extremely rare to get this done as it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Pharrell is the only known celebrity to have gotten this treatment.&nbsp;He successfully covered sleeves of tattoos without leaving any marks behind. He had previously said in an interview with <a href=#>Vogue</a>, “It’s going to be pricey, but worth it. I got fire on my arms! I’m a grown man!”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Post Malone's 20 Body And Face Tattoos Mean</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some tattoo artists won’t do relationship tattoos because they believe&nbsp;them to be a curse. Marriages can be divorced and annulled, while a tattoo with a lover’s name is forever. If anyone is considering a relationship tattoo that isn’t a beloved pet, family member, or friend, it's not commonly recommended. It’s going to be fifty times harder to get over an ex-boyfriend or girlfriend if their name is somewhere on your body.</p><p>If any of our readers want to forgo our advice, that’s fine. True love conquers all. Just please make the tattoo small. It will be easier to cover up, remove, or skin graft.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>20 Things We Just Learned About Kaley Cuoco's Time On Big Bang Theory</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoK6tsdhmmq6nk6R6p77OpmSboZdir6K6xmaroZ2fp8Zur86vnKudlGK1pr6MrZitrJ%2BkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
