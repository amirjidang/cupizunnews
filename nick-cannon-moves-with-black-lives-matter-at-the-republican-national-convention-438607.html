Nick Cannon made his way down to Cleveland, Ohio to lead the Black Lives Matter Movement outside the Republican National Convention yesterday (July 19). Cannon, along with protestors, marched up and down the streets of Cleveland, standing for what they believe in, peace in the streets.
“My community brought me down here today and the lack of representation for my community brought me down here today,” Cannon said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Cannon, along with protestors, marched up and down the streets of Cleveland, standing for what they believe in, peace in the streets.</p><p>“My community brought me down here today and the lack of representation for my community brought me down here today,” Cannon said. “We are just crying for help and we are losing lives by the hour.”</p><p>And they’re not backing down. The rapper and comedian, along with Black Lives Matter, will continue to fill the streets with the sounds of their voices throughout the entire convention. He’s saddened by both the Republican and Democratic party’s lack of speaking up on black issues and black votes, stating they have been taking black votes for granted for several years. His campaign slogan is nobody for president, as he rallies the community to not vote until their lives matter.</p><p>“We want to be respected,” Cannon&nbsp;said. “We want to feel safe. We want the American Dream. You are messing with our peace of mind. We can’t operate as Americans when we can’t walk outside and feel safe.”</p><p>Cannon rapped poetic justice on Black Lives Matter, spitting parables to abolish injustice within the African American community.</p><p>“So it’s like when I say save the whales, that don’t mean the other fish can’t float./ It just means that the whales are in danger./ Just like my species. / Discreetly. / It don’t matter who’s doing the killing, as long as we end up extinct, see. / This is the thesis in these secret meetings they having about me and the rest of my community.”</p><p>Behind his rhyme, without over powering Cannon’s voice, you get a chance to re-live the reality. Chants from the protestors through megaphones are heard, along with the sounds of honking horns from the movement in the streets as you get a visual of the community uniting for social change. He concluded the speech stating, “When they kill me, make sure they put on my tombstone, ‘Damn right, Black Lives Matter!,” fading into an echo.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O2pLeMnJinpp%2Bjeq671Z6qZq%2BZqbVursuamqRlnJ7Dpr%2BMppitrJWneqLAjK2fnmWimr22rsuimpqmXaOutbXOp5ilZZOku7exza2gqKZdaYB5go9wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
