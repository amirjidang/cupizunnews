With that in mind, it makes sense that there is renewed interest in what has happened to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’s cast including the actor who played the always hilarious butler Geoffrey. As it turns out, Joseph Marcell has led an amazing life since he last played Geoffrey.</p><h2 id=is-joseph-marcell-still-acting>Is Joseph Marcell Still Acting?</h2><p>For anyone who dreams of entertaining the world as an actor, landing a role in a popular TV show has to be a dream come true. However, the truth of the matter is that starring in a beloved show can also be a curse once the series ends. After all, there is a long history of actors who’ve seen their careers hit the skids after starring in a popular show since they are too closely associated with their famous character. For example, after Seinfeld ended, most of the show’s lead cast infamously struggled to find success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did The Cast Of ‘Seinfeld’ Struggle To Find Success After The Show Ended?</a></span></p><p>In the minds of many of the people who love The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it may seem like the actor who played Geoffrey in the show never enjoyed success after the show ended. In reality, however, Joseph Marcell has enjoyed an incredible career since he left his most popular role behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview, Joseph Marcell once revealed that when he was young, a mentor asked him if wanted to be rich and famous or have a long and respected career as an actor. While Marcell clearly is famous and he has a $2.5 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com, he has always prioritized having a long and rewarding career as an actor. With that in mind, it makes sense that since Marcell left The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air behind, he has spent years performing on stage for live audiences. In fact, Marcell considers himself to be a Shakespearean actor and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he is a board member of Shakespeare’s Globe theater</a> in London.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How 'Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air's' DJ Jazzy Jeff Amassed His $8.5 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>While there is no doubt that Joseph Marcell adores performing on stage, that doesn’t mean that he has lost his love for acting in front of cameras. After all, in the years since The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended, Marcell has amassed loads of television and film credits. For example, during the mid-2000s, Marcell joined the cast of the soap operas The Bold and the Beautiful and EastEnders. More recently, in 2020 Marcell lent his voice to a podcast that served as an audio adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s legendary comic book series The Sandman. Then in 2021, Marcell starred in a show called Mammoth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-is-joseph-marcell-now>Where Is Joseph Marcell Now?</h2><p>Even though it is extremely clear that Joseph Marcell deeply loves being an actor, that doesn’t mean that he has neglected the other parts of his life. Instead, Marcell seems to have a very loving family life. After getting married in 1975, Marcell welcomed his son Ben into the world. Sadly, Marcell’s first marriage came to an end in 1980 but he found love once again and walked down the aisle a second time in 1995. During his second marriage, Marcell and his wife Joyce T Walsh had a daughter named Jessica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently residing in Banstead, which is a town in the English county of Surrey, Joseph Marcell seems to have a close bond with his kids. As of the time of this writing, nothing is known about what Jessica Marcell has opted to do for a living. However, it is known that Ben Marcell has followed in his father’s footsteps. An actor, producer, and screenwriter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben has a handful of screen credits</a>. More notably, Ben inherited a love for being on stage as he has performed regularly as a part of an improv group and his famous father has been in the audience to support his son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before Joseph Marcell became a famous actor, he mostly grew up in the Peckham district of London, England. While a lot of people know that about Marcell, the truth of the matter is that he actually was born on the Caribbean Island Saint Lucia. More than that, Marcell has explained that he has always considered himself to be a Saint Lucian. With that in mind, it is awesome that in 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcell was named a Saint Lucian Goodwill Ambassador</a>. In that role, Marcell is “expected to represent Saint Lucia locally, regionally and internationally” and he has the title “Your Excellency”.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Alfonso Ribeiro Recently Reveals That 'Fresh Prince' Almost Ruined His Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brPEqJ2fqpWuerW0xGaZrqycmr9uu81mq6GdXZu%2Fpr%2FHZqeroZ6Ysm67xWaZnqRdlrazecmoqp6omGK6or7CnqOlZWJlf3N7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
