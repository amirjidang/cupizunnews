Not only is the 28-year-old star not interested in following a general diet or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wellness trends like celery juice</a>, she’s also not interested in greens, she told Us at the Hollywood Unlocked social impact brunch in L.A. “I don’t even eat vegetables!” she exclaimed.</p><p>But the BET Awards nominee did make it clear that she stays healthy and bloat-free in other ways — specifically, with intense dance cardio-based workouts. “On my own, I have a dance fitness program called fade2fit.com, so that’s the only workout I do,” she says of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">online video workouts</a>. “You can watch it and take it home, it’s all good.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Teyana-Taylor-Admits-She-Doesnt-Have-Healthiest-Diet-03.jpg><p>Still, the Teyana & Iman star — who is signed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>’s GOOD music record label and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">friends with the Kardashian-West family</a> — mostly credits genetics for her seriously in-shape body. “People used to call me a ninja turtle because even when I was six-years-old, I had a little Buddha belly but there was still a six-pack on top of it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Us</a> in 2018.</p><p>Taylor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed her daughter</a>, Iman Jr. (with NBA star <strong>Iman Shumpert</strong>), in December 2015. But she didn’t take much time off from her fitness regimen before or after the birth. “The only real workout I do is dancing and performing,” she added to Us. “I was touring right up until after I was six months pregnant and I was in really good shape, so after she came I just went right back down, almost immediately. That’s the way I do it — I love to dance.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Teyana-Taylor-Admits-She-Doesnt-Have-Healthiest-Diet-04.jpg><p>The star of West’s sultry “Fade” video made clear at the Hollywood Unlocked event that she’s specific about many things in her life. Despite her toned physique, she feels most empowered when she’s wearing more unisex styles. “Honestly,” she told Us, “I feel sexiest when I’m in tomboy mode, my baggy clothes.”</p><p>With reporting by Sanaz Sarshad</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGatnamWu6J505qwpaeiYrGqsdNmrqiqm6TCtXnNqGSvnZeawaKuy56qZp6RmbJzssitZKmqn5y%2FormO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
