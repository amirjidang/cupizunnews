A fan was quick to point out “girlfriends” is a term used by straight women to refer to their female friends, teasing the singer, who’s openly bisexual and has discussed her attraction to men and women in her songs.</p><p>The artist, who released her latest album <i>Manic</i> in January 2020, reassured her fandom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Not straight, just old I guess,” she wrote.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halsey Is Following In Kim Kardashian’s Footsteps By Studying To Become A Lawyer</a></span></p><h2 id=folklore-is-taylor-swift-s-eighth-studio-album>'Folklore' Is Taylor Swift's Eighth Studio Album</h2><p>Swift announced <i>Folklore</i> on social media a few hours before its release.
