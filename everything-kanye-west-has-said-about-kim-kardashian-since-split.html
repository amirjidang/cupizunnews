I can’t do that,” she explained. “He should have a wife that supports his every move and travels with him and does everything, and I can’t. I feel like a f–king failure. It’s my third f–king marriage. Yeah, I feel like a f–king loser. But I can’t even think about that. I want to be happy.”</p><p>The reality star elaborated on how <a href=#>West’s relocation to Wyoming</a> affected their marriage during an episode that aired later that month.</p><p>“After turning 40 this year, I realized like, ‘No, I <a href=#>don’t want a husband</a> that lives in a completely different state,’” she noted. “To me, I thought, ‘Oh, my God, that’s when we’re getting along the best,’ but then that is sad to me and that’s not what I want. I want someone that we have the same shows in common. I want someone who wants to work out with me. … I have all the big things. I have the extravagant everything you can possibly imagine and no one will ever do it like that — I know that, and I’m grateful for those experiences — but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder insisted during the June 2021 Keeping Up With the Kardashians reunion special that there was not “one specific thing that happened on either part” to <a href=#>cause the breakup</a>. Instead, “a general difference of opinions on a few things” led to the decision.</p><p>Kardashian and West — who share daughters <a href=#>North</a> and <a href=#>Chicago</a> and sons <a href=#>Saint</a> and <a href=#>Psalm</a> — remained friends after their split.
