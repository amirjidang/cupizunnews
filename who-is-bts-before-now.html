Considering they have skyrocketed to international fame and success, it is only fitting for fans to wonder just how the group got together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Is Richer: BlackPink Or BTS?</a></span></p><h2 id=everything-bts>Everything BTS!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BTS-Backstage-e1601597286936.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you are a fan of Korean Pop music are not, there is no denying the talent that BTS exudes! While they may be the biggest pop group in the music industry, many still don't know just how these 7 artists came to be. The journey first began back in 2010 when the Bangtan Boys first came to formation. BTS, which is made up of members, Jungkook, Suga, J-Hope, Kim Hyung-tae, Jin, Jimin, and RM, was <a href=#>first approached by Big Hit Entertainment CEO, Bang Si-hyuk.&nbsp;</a></p><p>The CEO had met with the group leader, RM, and was very impressed with the star's rapping capabilities. Bang Si-hyuk then presented RM with the idea of forming an all-boy K-Pop group, and the answer was an easy one! Members Jin, Suga, J-Hope were added in next, and the group was then finalized after the addition of Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012. RM, who serves as the group leader, was a rapper before breaking out with BTS and was quite well known across Korea at the time, therefore, it was only fitting for him to be the "star".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How BTS Members Amassed Their Massive Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BTS-K-Pop-e1601757869543.jpg><p>The BTS member's ages range from 27 years old to just 22 years old! While they may not always act their ages, the group has since transformed into the biggest K-Pop group in the world. Not only have they completely taken over South Korea and neighboring countries, but they have recently broken out in the United States and have since become incredibly mainstream. The group first debuted in 2013 with their album, 'Dark & Wild', and have since released 3 other Korean albums, and 4 Japanese albums.</p><p>BTS is set to release their 4th Korean album, 'Be', on November 20 with Big Hit and Columbia Records. With less than a decade in the industry, BTS has sold over 20 million physical albums, making them <a href=#>the best-selling Korean act of all time</a>. While they may only be breaking out in North American now, it is clear that the group is only set to go up from here, and we are more than looking forward to it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Watch: Here’s Why Jimmy Fallon Loves Korean Boy Band BTS</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurtOsZJudlqS%2FpnnNqK5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
