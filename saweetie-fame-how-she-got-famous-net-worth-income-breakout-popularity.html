In the last year, she's also acquired partnerships with McDonald’s, Mac Cosmetics, and Crocs — Get It Girl, right? It's truly amazing how much she's accomplished under five years in the mainstream biz. But how did she actually start? Here's everything we know about Saweetie's journey to stardom.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Saweetie Has Said About Real-Life Friendship With Doja Cat</a></span></p><h2 id=first-things-first-what-is-saweetie-39-s-real-name>First Things First: What Is Saweetie's Real Name?</h2><p>Born Diamonte Quiava Valentin Harper to a Filipino Chinese mother and African American father, Saweetie's stage name is actually a nickname given to her by her grandmother who witnessed her promising musical talent at an early age. She reportedly began writing music and poems at the age of 14. She did open mics, joined talent shows, and pursued rap while studying and working three jobs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Determined to make it in the industry, she started recording songs using her phone when she was 15. She even filmed music videos. After graduating from the University of Southern California with a degree in communication and business, Saweetie decided to focus on her music aspirations. She moved to Los Angeles to build a reputation as a freestyle rapper. In 2016, she began gaining traction on her Instagram where she would post short clips of her rapping.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything That Led To Quavo And Saweetie's Infamous Elevator Fight</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-saweetie-get-famous>How Did Saweetie Get Famous?</h2><p>An Instagram video of Saweetie rapping over Khia's My Neck, My Back (Lick It) went viral in 2016. Soon it became a single called ICY GRL and was released on Soundcloud in the same year. Its official music video currently has over 120 million views on YouTube. Because of such good reception, the overnight sensation released an EP in early 2018 called High Maintenance. For three good years, Saweetie would experience tons of success from that single. At the height of her song's popularity, she earned Tidal's Artist of the Week and Pigeons & Planes' Best New Artist of the Month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She eventually landed a record deal with Warner Records and Artistry Worldwide which is owned by her manager, Max Gousse — the producer and A&R executive who discovered her through her viral track. In June 2018, ICY GRL received a Gold Certificate for making more than half a million sales in the US. The following year, it received an RIAA multi-platinum certificate and reached #1 on Billboard's rhythmic songs airplay chart. Saweetie released her second EP in the same year. Its first track My Type peaked at #21 on Billboard's Hot 100. It was her first entry on the list's Top 40.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Saweetie Reveals What Paris Hilton Is Really Like When She Appears On Her Podcast</a></span></p><h2 id=what-saweetie-has-said-about-her-recent-successes>What Saweetie Has Said About Her Recent Successes</h2><p>In a recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Billboard</a>, Saweetie shared what it felt to be nominated in two major Grammy categories. She said she was "caught off guard" but feels like "everything is falling into place as it should be." The rapper revealed that she woke up to the good news. "I think we’ve been working really hard," she added. "[2021] is the year I think I’ve worked the hardest and not just out of my career but in my years of being on the Earth. So to be acknowledged is very gratifying after a year of hard work."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked about her business ventures, Saweetie said that she's particularly proud of her collaboration with Mcdonald's. "I’ve loved McDonald's ever since I was a little kid," she gushed. "They’re a top 10 food chain franchise that’s known globally, and the fact that I was an ambassador just opened so many doors for me. So I was grateful for the experience. You don’t see a lot of people doing it — and I was the first woman, at that." Indeed, Saweetie has been making history in almost every move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her Grammy nomination is part of a big win for the Filipino community. Other Filipino-American artists like Olivia Rodrigo, H.E.R., and Bruno Mars have all received multiple nominations as well. "It was such a major win, because you don’t see a lot of Filipino artists in hip-hop or R&B," Saweetie said of the achievement. "I think that it’s great that we celebrate our culture so that people who are of our blood, look like us and come from where we come from as far as origin goes know that they can do it too. Representation is really important — and I’m glad that was actually highlighted because I saw a couple of articles [about it]. I was pleased with that."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Lil Baby Throws Shade At Saweetie Then Deletes Tweets, Amid A Flurry Of Dating Rumors</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmq%2BVmsGqsYyfmKadXZ28uHnSoZxmn5%2BpeqetzKisrGWemsFuw86rq6FlmaOwsLnEZpmrnZGgvLbAjKmmqa2clr%2BqwNho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
