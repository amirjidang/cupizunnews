After initially studying film and TV production, the California native <a href=#>changed his major to focus on archaeology</a> and ultimately graduated in 2015.</p><p>The photographer <a href=#>made his onscreen return when he booked the role of Jughead</a> Jones on The CW’s <a href=#>Riverdale</a>. After the show premiered in 2017, <a href=#>fans quickly picked up on the chemistry</a> between Cole and costar <a href=#><strong>Lili Reinhart</strong></a>, who portrayed Betty Cooper.</p><p>The twosome <a href=#>played love interviews on the hit series</a>, going on to date on and off for <a href=#>more than two years before announcing their split.</a></p><p>“Lili and I initially separated in January of this year, deciding to more permanently split in March,” Cole explained via Instagram in August 2020. “What an incredible experience I had, I’ll always feel lucky and cherish that I had the chance to fall in love. I wish her nothing but the utmost love and happiness moving forward. All I’ll say about it, anything else you hear doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Reinhart, meanwhile, said <a href=#>she felt like she was “dying” during the aftermath</a> of the split.</p><p>“It was f—king rough, and there’s no other way through it than just through it,” she told Refinery29 that same month. “I’ve seen a lot of people when it comes to heartache and grief and breakups, and they try to get that void filled with sex, with coke, with food, with drinking, [but] the void is still there. I took the road less traveled and just dealt with my s—t. I had to face my own pain head-on.”</p><p>The former Disney Channel star later opened up about <a href=#>the challenges he faced while continuing to film with his ex-girlfrien</a><a href=#>d</a>. “It was hard to suspend all the way we felt about each other and it didn’t afford us the luxury of distance to really overcome that,” he said on a March 2023 episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. “I know we both did quite a bit of damage to each other. We’re good friends now, which is awesome.”</p><p>While he didn’t go into major detail, Cole <a href=#>recalled what prompted the actors to pull the plug</a>. “I think if I had loved myself a little more, I probably would have left [my relationship with Lili] a little earlier,” he added. “I just felt like I had to take care of a lot of people around me, which was not good for me. I probably should have exercised a bit more selfishness in that situation.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Cole went on to <a href=#>praise his then-girlfriend, <strong>Ari Fournier</strong></a>. “She’s my best friend,” he gushed of the model, to whom he was first linked to in 2021. “We get along so well, we do everything together. … As a consequence of our relationship, my life has just improved.”</p><p>Scroll on to revisit the actor’s complete dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksLC4xGaqqaqfqsCmv4ydmK2hnpx6qbXSraarsV2htq21jKucoqaYlr%2B1ecyoqZ5llpa6sMHSZpyxnaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
