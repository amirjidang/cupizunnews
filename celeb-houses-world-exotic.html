Who doesn’t want to own a house or an apartment in Spain or the Caribbean? It’s a dream that most of us have and while some of us get to realize it, most of us have to rent holiday homes or hotel rooms whenever we go to exotic places.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, celebrities are quite different – because they make so much money they can afford to treat themselves to numerous luxurious holiday villas. In fact, some of them end up treating themselves to private holiday islands. You can never have too much privacy, right?</p><p>As you can imagine, these luxury holiday villas and apartments cost millions of dollars so sometimes when celebrities grow tired of a specific exotic place they sell their villa and buy a holiday home elsewhere.</p><p>Since celebrities have little to no privacy in their daily lives it is no wonder that they choose far-away, exotic places as their holiday destinations and holiday home purchases.</p><h2 id=michael-fassbender-bought-an-apartment-in-portugal><strong>Michael Fassbender Bought An Apartment In Portugal</strong></h2><p>The German born Irish actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Fassbender</a>, best known for his roles in films such as <a href=#>X-Men</a>, <a href=#>12 Years a Slave</a> and <a href=#>Inglorious Basterds</a>, recently bought a lavish holiday home in Portugal. The apartment is located in an upmarket hilltop district of Alfama in Lisbon, a district that is said to be one of the best in Lisbon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fassbender paid around $2.3 million for this property but it does come with a private garden terrace and a swimming pool. In addition, the apartment overlooks the river Tagus. We’re sure now that the actor has bought this luxurious home he will be spending plenty of time in Portugal.</p><h2 id=george-clooney-owns-a-villa-on-lake-como><strong>George Clooney Owns A Villa On Lake Como</strong></h2><p>When the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Clooney</a> is not working, he likes to retire to his holiday home in Italy. The house, or rather, the villa, known as Villa Oleandra, is located in the Italian commune of Laglio on the western shore of Lake Como.</p><p><strong>Clooney first fell in love with the villa in 2001 when he was riding past it on his motorbike. Not long after he decided to buy the stunning holiday home for around $10 million dollars.</strong></p><p>The house has since been visited by celebrities such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cindy Crawford</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Damon</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catherine Zeta Jones</a>, all friends of Clooney. No doubt, having a home in Italy is more than admirable, and the fact that he gets to wake up and walk around the beautiful town or hop a train and go wherever he wants in the gorgeous province is definitely a plus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-own-a-luxurious-villa-in-majorca><strong>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt Own A Luxurious Villa In Majorca</strong></h2><p>In 2016 it has been reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> bought a luxurious villa in Majorca. Apparently the villa cost Hollywood’s famous couple around $3.73 million dollars. Peanuts, right?</p><p>So, how did Jolie and Pitt come across it? Rumor has it that the couple fell in love with the island itself first when Pitt was filming the film Allied there.</p><p>The couple then asked Alessandro Proto, a real-estate tycoon, for his help in finding a suitable holiday home. As&nbsp;you can see, he managed to find them a luxury villa that boasts eight bedrooms, a garden and a swimming pool. We have no idea what happened to this beautiful place in the divorce, but whoever got it is super lucky.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-owns-a-holiday-home-in-capri>Mariah Carey Owns A Holiday Home In Capri</h2><p>The singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey </a>has had a lot of holiday homes outside of the States. However, over the years she ended up selling quite a few of them, including her Caribbean holiday home on Windermere Island in the Bahamas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, it seems like the singer still owns her holiday home on the island of Capri which she bought in 2004 after signing a successful recording contract. The holiday mansion in Capri apparently cost Carey around $7.5 million!</p><p>Back in 2004 she relaxed there with her mother and in 2016 she spent a lot of time there with her then fiancé <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Packer.</a></p><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-owns-a-ranch-on-the-island-of-maui><strong>Oprah Winfrey Owns A Ranch On The Island Of Maui</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah Winfrey</a> loves Hawaii and in particular the Island of Maui. Indeed, Winfrey has bought land in East Maui as well as the historic Thompson Ranch near Keokea.</p><p>Oprah’s decorator, Ellie, helped decorate the home and has said that&nbsp;Oprah's Hawaiian home is rather small –</p><p><strong>“She liked [the home's] small scale. She already has a large home in Santa Barbara—this seems to go back to something real and personal. It's a great house for her and two or three friends."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is said that on her farm Winfrey grows over 100 different&nbsp;types of local products such as herbs, fruits and vegetables. Considering all her money, we would naturally&nbsp;assume she would want something even more grand. But then she wouldn't be who she was, we suppose.</p><h2 id=naomi-campbell-s-stunning-holiday-home-shaped-like-the-egyptian-eye-of-horus><strong>Naomi Campbell's Stunning Holiday Home Shaped Like The Egyptian Eye Of Horus</strong></h2><p>For her 41st birthday <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Naomi Campbell </a>was lucky enough to receive a beautiful holiday home from her then-boyfriend and Russian billionaire Vladislav Doronin. Doronin got the model a stunning island holiday home that is shaped like the Egyptian eye of Horus.</p><p>The house is located on Cleopatra Island in the Gulf of Gokova, Turkey and looks absolutely stunning. However, it is not just the exterior of the house that is impressive – the way the house operates is pretty amazing too. You see, the holiday home was designed by the Spanish architect Luis de Garrido who is known for his amazing eco-house designs. The holiday home is thus totally energy and water self-sufficient.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-branson-owns-his-own-private-island><strong>Richard Branson Owns His Own Private Island</strong></h2><p>Why own a holiday home when you can own a whole holiday island? That’s exactly what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Branson</a> must have been thinking when he bought a luxury island resort located on Necker Island in the Caribbean. It must be nice to have all that money just resting on your fingertips, don't you think?</p><p>Branson is not greedy however and turned the island into a private island retreat where almost anyone with enough money can rent it out – it costs $65,000 a day or $2,167 a day for 30 guests. Is he crazy? Does he think we all have that kind of money sitting around? Some of us have bills to pay!</p><p>Unfortunately, Hurricane Irma which raged through the island caused extensive damage to Branson’s paradise but we are sure that he will rebuild it in no time.</p><h2 id=david-copperfield-bought-numerous-private-islands><strong>David Copperfield Bought Numerous Private Islands</strong></h2><p>The world famous magician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Copperfield</a> was obviously thinking on the same lines as Branson – why buy a holiday home when you can buy a holiday island instead? So that’s exactly what he did in 2006 – he purchased a private island known as Musha Cay for $50 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Apparently,&nbsp;Copperfield spent a further $40 million remodelling the island until it became, in Copperfield’s own words, the “most magical vacation destination in the world.”</strong></p><p>Owning a private island must feel amazing but Copperfield decided not to settle for just one island. Indeed, shortly after purchasing Musha Cay he bought ten more nearby islands which all together make up an archipelago that today is known as Copperfield’s Bay.</p><h2 id=giorgio-armani-owns-a-holiday-villa-in-saint-tropez><strong>Giorgio Armani Owns A Holiday Villa In Saint Tropez</strong></h2><p>The famous Italian fashion designer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giorgio Armani</a> owns a luxurious holiday villa in Saint Tropez which he bought in 1996 and which he designed himself –</p><p><strong>“I like to do my own things. I don’t have anything against architects, but if you can design yourself, it’s better.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years Armani carried out only modest renovations on the villa but following a health scare in 2009 he decided to embark on a proper renovation – “I got out of the hospital, and in the arc of about four days the plans were all done, in every detail. It was a big stimulation for me. I did the St Moritz house at the same time. But I think that’s enough, no? Otherwise, every time I have a headache, I’ll design a new palazzo!”</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-owns-a-private-island-in-the-bahamas><strong>Johnny Depp Owns A Private Island In The Bahamas</strong></h2><p>The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp</a> has also decided that owning a holiday home is not serious enough and instead decided to buy a private island. Depp apparently purchased his island in the Bahamas in 2004 for $3.6 million. His island is known as Little Halls Pond Cay.</p><p>The island boasts six beaches, which Johnny Depp has named Paradis, Lily Rose, Jack, Brando and Gonzo. As you can probably imagine, Depp is in love with his little private retreat and has said – “I don’t think I’d ever seen any place so pure and beautiful. You can feel your pulse rate drop about 20 beats. It’s instant freedom.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-mccartney-owns-a-farm-in-kintyre><strong>Paul McCartney Owns A Farm In Kintyre</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul McCartney</a> also owns a holiday home outside the USA. In 1996, he bought High Park Farm in Kintyre, a secluded peninsula in Western Scotland. He lived there with his former wife Linda McCartney where he found much needed peace and tranquility.</p><p>According to the locals, over the years&nbsp;McCartney expanded the farm greatly –</p><p><strong>“Over the years, Sir Paul has bought what used to be about seven different holdings, The aim seems to have been to ensure privacy by purchasing neighboring stretches of land."</strong></p><p>However, the locals have said that they have not seen McCartney at the farm for about half a decade. Indeed, nowadays McCartney spends&nbsp;most of his time either in London or America.</p><h2 id=mel-gibson-owns-mago-island-which-is-part-of-the-fuji-island-chain>Mel Gibson Owns Mago Island Which Is Part Of The Fuji Island Chain</h2><p>In 2005 the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel Gibson</a> decided to splash out on his own little paradise – he purchased a volcanic island, known as Mago island, for $15 million. The island is part of the Fuji island chain and&nbsp;indeed it is said that Mago Island is one of the largest private islands in southwest Pacific Ocean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, in 2013 Gibson began running a cattle farm on the island and even had government officials visiting his place. One official later said - "The ministry appreciates the fact that private sector players like him (Gibson) are involved and can be drivers in the industry." However, he sold the farm in 2016 for $5 million.</p><h2 id=marc-anthony-owns-his-own-resort-in-the-dominican-republic><strong>Marc Anthony Owns His Own Resort In The Dominican Republic</strong></h2><p>The American singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Anthony</a> recently bought a holiday home in the Dominican Republic. The Casa de Campo resort, owned by the singer and his wife Shannon de Lima Muniz, boasts countless of guest bungalows, pavilions, cabanas and swimming pools.</p><p>However, the resort wasn’t always so luxurious. Indeed, when Anthony first set eyes on it it only had one main house, one swimming pool and plenty of wild vegetation. But the singer knew that the place had huge potential – “The second we moved in I started drawing my ideas on napkins and buying up the adjacent lots. I just had a vision for it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bruce-willis-owns-a-luxurious-villa-in-parrot-cay><strong>Bruce Willis Owns A Luxurious Villa In Parrot Cay</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Willis</a> is one of those celebrities who values peace and tranquility. That’s why he owns a luxurious villa in Parrot Cay, a private island resort that is an extension of the Turks and Caicos Islands.</p><p><strong>It was at Parrot Cay that Willis married his second wife Emma Heming in 2009.</strong></p><p>Since Willis and Heming chose the private island for their wedding ceremony it only made sense that they had very few wedding guests. These included his ex-wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Demi Moore</a> and her ex-husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a> as well as Willis’ children.</p><p>Willis’ villa on the island is pretty impressive and boasts a 5 bedroom house, a swimming pool and 3 guest residences each with their own swimming pool.</p><h2 id=sting-owns-a-luxurious-holiday-villa-in-tuscany><strong>Sting Owns A Luxurious Holiday Villa In Tuscany</strong></h2><p>Back in 1999 the musician <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sting</a> bought a luxurious holiday villa, known as Villa “Il Palagio” in Tuscany. The villa comes with its own two guest houses, a recording studio, numerous gardens and vineyards as well as a quiet place for practicing yoga.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sting usually visits his luxury villa in the summer and thus not wanting it go to waste the musician started renting it out for weddings and other special celebrations.</p><p>Fancy staying in Sting’s villa? Well then we hope you have around $8,641 a week to spare. You can never rent it out in August however, probably because that is when Sting usually visits it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiblaGyo3nHqKysnaNixLC%2By51knrCfqbakew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
