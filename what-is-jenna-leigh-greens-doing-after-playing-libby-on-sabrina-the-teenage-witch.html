Beth Broderick, Caroline Rhea, and Nick Bakay were all charming as the young witch's Aunt Zelda, Aunt Hilda, and the sarcastic and plotting cat Salem. Jenna Leigh Green rounded out the cast as Libby Chessler, the mean girl at school who never misses an opportunity to make fun of Sabrina. In almost every episode, Libby fights Sabrina for Harvey Kinkle's affections. Of course, fans know that Harvey and Sabrina belong together and Libby never stands a chance.</p><p>Melissa Joan Hart has been in the spotlight ever since the show ended in 2003, but some of the other actors have been a little bit quieter. <a href=#>Nate Richert has been fairly private after Sabrina</a>, and Jenna Leigh Green isn't in the news very often, either. One thing is certain, Green's life took an interesting turn since she left the popular ABC/The WB series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-jenna-leigh-green-after-sabrina-the-teenage-witch>What Happened To Jenna Leigh Green After Sabrina The Teenage Witch?</h2><p>While <a href=#>one episode of Sabrina The Teenage Witch was pretty weird</a>, the sitcom was generally sweet, funny, and relatable. Sabrina goes to a normal high school, has some regular experiences, hangs out with her friends, and dates Harvey Kinkle. She also verbally spars with Jenna Leigh Green's character, Libby Chessler, on a regular basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jenna-leigh-green-2.jpg><p>Libby is a layered character because while she seems like a typical mean girl at first, she does have some feelings. Over time, she is revealed to be nicer than she seemed. Jenna Leigh Green played this character for three seasons and then left Sabrina.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Melissa Joan Hart Has Been Up To Since 'Sabrina The Teenage Witch'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When glancing at Green's career, it's clear that Sabrina The Teenage Witch was her most famous TV show. Her other credits include episodes of TV shows such as Bones, Castle, Dharma & Greg, and Ghost Whisperer. She starred in TV movies like Friends 'Til The End and her most recent credits include one episode of Blue Bloods and Magnum P.I. which aired in 2022.</p><p>There is an interesting reason why the actress hasn't acted much on TV or in movies since Sabrina The Teenage Witch. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenna Leigh Green has had a musical theater career</a>.</p><p>In 2016, Green was interviewed by Bleep Mag and she talked about starring in musicals such as The Marvelous Wonderettes, Wicked, and Bare.

She said she traveled to California, Texas, and Chicago, which was cool. She also talked about starring in Bare when she was finished playing Libby on Sabrina.</p><p>Green explained more about her theater background. She said, "I started off on stage when I was pretty young, at 11 or 12. I did theatre all over Southern California. I kinda fell into TV. Theatre is where I thought I would end up. I was doing Into The Woods, I got my first manager and then “Sabrina” came really quickly. Doing that show really was a “throw me into the pool and see how she swims” experience."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jenna-leigh-green-s-life-changed-forever-after-she-stopped-playing-libby-on-sabrina-the-teenage-witch.jpg><p>Green continued to Bleep Mag, "Even during Sabrina, I did two big stage productions in LA.

Green said that she has a twin and her mother felt that she could find some confidence by singing and acting. Green explained that she loved going to see Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera when she was young. The shows inspired her a lot, and it sounds like she never thought about an alternative career path.</p><h2 id=what-did-jenna-leigh-green-say-about-sabrina-the-teenage-witch>What Did Jenna Leigh Green Say About Sabrina The Teenage Witch?</h2><p>Even though Jenna Leigh Green stopped playing Libby on Sabrina The Teenage Witch in 1999, she continues to promote the series.
