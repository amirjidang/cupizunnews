Ginny is devastated by this. All of this came out of the blue.”</p><p>And Barber and Johnson’s affair was more than just a fling: the Post reports that they began sleeping together in 2008, when she was a 21-year-old college student. The athlete lavished gifts — roses, jewelry, designer clothes — on Johnson, and she flaunted her “boyfriend’s” blue Maserati on Facebook last September.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The lovers supposedly even lunched together in public at 30 Rock, NBC’s Manhattan headquarters.</p><p>“On her 21st birthday, he sent her 21 roses to her her dorm. He also gave her a diamond and sapphire bracelet,” a source tells the Post.</p><p>Barber’s rep would not comment beyond the statement released on Wednesday. “This decision was a painful one,” Barber said. “But we are moving forward amicably and will continue to work together to raise our children with the love and dedication they have always known.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZueeqOt0Zucq6tdpb%2Bms82apa1lp56zpnnDnq2aq6SWwaawjJuwZpmWm66qvoywoK2gXZ67tbHRp2Rra12nsrG70a1ka2hhZYZ1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
