The private home is only accessible from a single, gated entry, has a mile long driveway surrounded by aspen forest, and sits on 320 acres of land. Despite being less than fifteen minutes from popular ski resort town Telluride, most who live in the area have never even scene the house – or its A-List owner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the incredible views and promise of privacy that would likely appeal to many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities</a>, reports say that Cruise has struggled to sell the property in the past. Now the Colorado compound is currently on the market again –this time for $39.5 Million.</p><h2 id=luxury-meets-legend-cruise-s-mountain-compound>“Luxury Meets Legend” – Cruise’s Mountain Compound</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The ranch-style estate</a> is located in Telluride, Colorado. Cruise spent years designing the home, which was built to his specifications in 1994. Styled like a massive luxury log cabin, the 11,512 sq. foot home boasts seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two fireplaces, a spa, a fitness center, and a guest house (that has three bedrooms of its own.) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The grounds</a> feature a sports court, dirt bike, and snow mobile track, and extensive hiking trails.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The biggest draw is how much acreage you have. The driveway is over a mile long. The privacy level is outrageous, while also being five to nine minutes away from the downtown and the slopes,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Eric Lavey</a> of LIV Sotheby’s International Realty told House Beautiful.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to comments made to the Denver Post by Dan Dockray</a> of LIV Sotheby’s International Realty, Cruise soft marketed the property with an asking price of $ 59,000,000 seven years ago. It is unknown why Cruise did not officially list the property then, or why he has chosen to list the property now, at a reduced price. “I think [Cruise] wasn’t ready yet, although I can’t speak for the seller’s reasons,” Dockray said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In The Wall Street Journal</a>, a spokeswoman for Cruise didn’t respond to requests for comment on his reasons for selling, but the agents for the listing have stated that it has been some time since the actor spent time in the mountain compound.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Cruise Returns To Mission: Impossible 7 Set After Going Ballistic</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-cruise-is-no-stranger-to-the-housing-market>Tom Cruise is No Stranger to the Housing Market</h2><p>The stunning mountain home is not the only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">property</a> that Cruise has put on the market. Since 2013,&nbsp;he has put <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at least six </a>high-cost properties on the market.</p><p>In 2013, Cruise listed two New York City properties. One was an incredible East Village condominium unit in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Felt Building</a>, which sold for $3 Million. The other was very likely (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">despite denials from Cruise’s representation</a>) a Greenwich Village townhouse for $28 Million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, the star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">listed</a> his Hollywood Hills Compound. The gated, European-style villa is located right off of Mulholland Drive, and like the mountain house in CO, is hidden from outsiders by a long driveway. Despite the incredible views of LA, the actor sold the estate at a loss: $11.4 Million, $1.6 Million below the asking price.</p><p>That same year, he listed a stunning country estate in the UK, about thirty miles south of London. Converted from GBP, the property listed at about $7.4 Million.</p><p>Most surprisingly, the Hollywood star also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold his Beverly Hills manor</a> that year as well. The unique property is over 10,000 sq. feet and includes seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, lighted tennis courts with basketball hoops, a swimming pool, and two large guest houses. It was purchased by multi-billionaire Leon Black for $40 Million.</p><p>“Tom has long planned to leave LA,” a source told People Magazine, “It’s not the center of his life anymore.”</p><h2 id=a-skyview-in-clearwater-where-tom-cruise-lives-now>A Skyview in Clearwater – Where Tom Cruise Lives Now</h2><p>The Hollywood leading man has now relocated to a more perplexing location – a former bank in Clearwater, Florida.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star’s new home is the top two floors of the former bank have been transformed into a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxurious penthouse</a> for Cruise. The building is now renamed “The Skyview.” While this building is not set far off the road with a long driveway or a gated entrance like Cruise’s mountain house, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports say</a> that the exterior of the Skyview is covered in security cameras – so it seems likely that security is still a&nbsp;priority at the new accommodations. The chic penthouse itself features a roof deck, a 39-foot infinity pool, solarium, hot tub, bar, and even a flight simulator.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>6 Facts On Bryan Cranston's $5 Million Custom Beach House</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Soethebys Realthy</a>, <a href=#>The Denver Post</a>, <a href=#>House Beautiful</a>, <a href=#>WSJ</a>, <a href=#>brobible</a>, <a href=#>The Underground Bunker</a>, <a href=#>Insider</a>, <a href=#>Variety</a>, <a href=#>Business Insider</a>, <a href=#>People</a>, <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLmMnKmuoaOaeq671KermqGeYrWwwdKeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
