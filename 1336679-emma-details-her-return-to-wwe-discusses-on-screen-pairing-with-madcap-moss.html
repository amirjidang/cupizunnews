During her five years away from WWE, she had a run with IMPACT Wrestling, and she also worked on the independent scene. On the October 28 episode of WWE SmackDown, <a href=#>Emma returned to WWE</a> and answered an open challenge by SmackDown Women’s Champion Ronda Rousey.</p><p>During an appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>Out of Character with Ryan Satin</a>, Emma described how her return came together. She noted that her contract with IMPACT Wrestling was coming up, and seeing all of the changes following Triple H’s rise to power prompted her to consider potentially coming back. Emma then described how Triple H told her she was on his list of people he wanted to alk to.</p><p>“I guess it would have been within a few months after Triple H returned, and I actually was working with IMPACT, and my contract was coming up,” Emma said. “I guess maybe even without really realizing it, I had this idea in my mind that maybe I’m done with IMPACT, and maybe there are other options that I should explore, and to kind of see what’s possible. That was probably coming from me watching WWE and seeing all these awesome changes, and Triple H, what he was doing, and I know I had that kind of good rapport with him, and all the stuff he did at NXT.</p><p>“So I just probably in the back of my mind started thinking like oh, I wonder if I could actually go back to WWE? Then it was within a short time after that, probably a month or two, we ended up in touch, and he actually said that he’d been meaning to reach out even sooner, that I’d been on his list, and he’s just been swamped, as you can imagine. So that’s kind of when the conversation finally kicked off, and then went from there. Next thing you know, I’m actually back. I joked about it so many times, and all of a sudden, I was like, oh, this is actually happening. I’m coming back to WWE after five years.</p><p>Shortly after her return, Emma was paired up with Madcap Moss, her real-life boyfriend, and she made it clear that she has been enjoying this experience.</p><p>“I’m still kind of pinching myself sometimes because I really enjoy what I do,” Emma said. “Even Madcap and I, we joked about it so many times, like ‘Imagine if we actually worked together’ and all these storylines and things we would do, and then I actually end up back on the same show as him, and then in a storyline together, which we never even had discussed. We joked about it, but we never really thought it would happen, and we didn’t discuss it with other people.”</p><p>When asked, Emma confirmed that she and Madcap did not pitch the idea of working together, but they were pleasantly surprised, and now they’re trying to make the most of it.</p><p>“That wasn’t us. You’d think maybe it was, but obviously, he has his own ideas, and I have mine. I just thought, okay, they’re bringing me back, and I had this and that in my mind, and then I think it was a week or two in, they’re like, ‘Okay, we’re gonna put you guys together.’ We were like, ‘What?’ But then it was like this is cool, we get to work together and be an on-screen couple. What a cool thing. So we’re definitely making the most of it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsbW9vaWKyrrnAZpuerJGeubR5x56pZqqVqcKzuoytpmavp5p6pbXSnKysq5WoerC6jKyaq52Vo3qxrciroKefXay2tbSMppidm5Gleq670qw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
