Due to the show dealing with serious subjects, such as violence, drugs, abuse, and personal loss, the cast became close during the making of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were some cast members who couldn't wait to get away from the show when everything was finished, but for the key players, going through such an intense experience bonded them like the welds&nbsp;that held&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show's Harley-Davidsons</a> together.</p><p>With the final episode airing in December 2014, it has now been a few years since everyone was on set, and many fans are wondering if they stayed close after the curtains closed on SAMCRO.</p><h2 id=an-absent-charlie-hunnam><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>An Absent Charlie Hunnam</span></h2><p>During many 'Anarchy' cast reunions, the absence of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">versatile actor, Charlie Hunnam</a>, is normally the first thing that people notice. This doesn't mean that there is any bad blood between the cast and Hunnam; it is more to do with the actor's schedule since he became famous.</p><p>Since starring as Jax, Hunnam has performed in movies such as&nbsp;King Arthur, The Lost City Of Z, Papillon,&nbsp;and many others, cramming as much as he can into his time. He still gets together with the 'Anarchy' cast it fits his schedule, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Hunnam And Morgana McNelis: 15 Sweet Facts About The Couple</a></span></p><h2 id=the-pickle-photos><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The Pickle Photos</span></h2><p>One good indicator that the cast has stayed friends is the humor they bring to public appearances since the finale. Instead of just turning up to sign autographs and mindlessly "meet and greet", many of the cast will joke around and have a good time together.</p><p>One of these moments came when&nbsp;Ryan Hurst, Ron Perlman, Theo Rossi, and Tommy Flanagan brought a bowl of pickles (an inside joke) to the fan photo-op at Pittsburgh's Steel City Con, 2019.</p><h2 id=yoga-classes-with-charlie-hunnam-and-ryan-hurst><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Yoga Classes With Charlie Hunnam and Ryan Hurst</span></h2><p>It turns out that both Ryan Hurst and Charlie Hunnam are passionate yoga practitioners, and they jointly gave an introductory lesson in Kundalini yoga at the 2019 Motor City Comic Con, to entertain and educate fans. Their shared love of yoga is one of the main things that's united them since the show ended. They regularly see each other and even meet at the same yoga studio to do their thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reuniting-for-mark-bobby-boone-s-wedding><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Reuniting For Mark "Bobby" Boone's Wedding</span></h2><p>Wedding invites are normally sent to friends and family of the lucky couple, so it's no surprise that when Mark Boone Junior was getting ready to marry his girlfriend, Christina Adshade, the Sons of Anarchy&nbsp;family&nbsp;got invites.</p><p>While a few of them were too busy to attend, Instagram was quickly filled with pics of happy faces, including Kim Coates, Tommy Flanagan, Drea De Matteo, Katey Sagal, and David Labrava. These cast members all posed with Boone Junior and Adshade.</p><h2 id=comic-con-in-wrexham-wales><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Comic Con In Wrexham, Wales</span></h2><p>It will become apparent which former cast members are willing to spend extra time together - and have a blast! The 2018 Comic Con in Wrexham, Wales, gave audience members a surprise. Attendees were treated to an appearance from the show's stars, with Kim Coates, Tommy Flanagan, and Theo Rossi pictured above. Ryan Hurst and Charlie Hunnam also showed up backstage, and hung out with actors and fans alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=allan-o-neill-s-death><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Allan O'Neill's Death</span></h2><p>Playing an IRA gunrunner on the show, from 2013 to 2014, O'Neill had a semi-close relationship with some of the Sons of Anarchy cast members. He spent time with them after the show ended, at a couple of their private reunions. Unfortunately, the actor passed away in 2018 due to heart problems, leaving the 'Anarchy' family a member short.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Actors Who Regretted Being On Sons Of Anarchy (And 18 Who Adored It)</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-lewis-death><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Johnny Lewis' Death</span></h2><p>One that is also missed, Lewis starred in the first two seasons of Sons of&nbsp;Anarchy,&nbsp;quickly forming close bonds with the crew and cast, especially the show's creator, Kurt Sutter. However, Lewis went on to quit the show after season 2 in 2009, because of creative differences between himself and Sutter.</p><p>After his death in 2012, the show repeatedly made mention of his character throughout season 6. This was done to honor the relationship he had with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=theo-rossi-and-kim-coates><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Theo Rossi And Kim Coates</span></h2><p>Coates and Rossi are usually always the ones appearing at interviews and putting in the hard yards outside of the show. They often choose to work together, too, rather than working with other former cast members from Sons of Anarchy.</p><p>Rossi has previously referred to the fact that he, Coates, and other cast members would spend most of their time either filming the show or hanging out together during the off-season. These two have repeatedly made time for reunions, years after the show ended.</p><h2 id=kurt-sutter-and-katey-sagal-are-still-going-strong><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kurt Sutter And&nbsp;Katey Sagal Are Still Going Strong</span></h2><p>For those who were not aware, Katey Sagal married Sons of Anarchy creator, Kurt Sutter, in 2004, 4 years prior to the release of season 1 of the show. Sagal has made it clear in a number of interviews that she found it very difficult portraying her character, Gemma Teller Morrow, as Katey felt the character's personality was the polar opposite of her own...and the polar opposite of previous characters she'd played.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The experience, such as Sutter watching&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemma die a horrible death</a>, did no damage to their relationship.</p><h2 id=kurt-sutter-and-charlie-hunnam><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kurt Sutter and Charlie Hunnam</span></h2><p>There is one word for these two men - chemistry...the kind that exists between a writer/producer/director and his leading actor after pulling off a hit show.&nbsp;Sutter has invited Hunnam to lead in any of his up-and-coming projects if Hunnam can find room somewhere in his schedule.</p><p>The two, along with Katey Sagal, have seen each other more in 2020 than before. Each are working on different projects in London and living in the same area.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We've Ranked All The Sons Of Anarchy Stars, By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=the-ruined-reunion><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Ruined Reunion</span></h2><p>Two years after the end of season 7, the cast (including Danny Trejo, David Labrava, Ron Perlman, and more) arrived at the 2016 Space City Comic Con in Houston. This is an instance where the group's public appearance went south.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Comic Con promoter at this venue gave the cast bad checks that bounced, and then called the police when confronted - this left everybody unpaid. They all pulled together, helping each other out with the police, and going for a drink afterwards.</p><h2 id=prom-night-with-perlman-and-hurst><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Prom Night With Perlman And Hurst</span></h2><p>While there is not a lot of information regarding a future relationship between Perlman and Hurst, aside from the above reunions, a prom photo the&nbsp;two actors eagerly took part in during the 2016 Space City Comic Con proves that they aren't afraid of each other. This image was also proudly posted to each of the actor's Facebook feeds.</p><h2 id=out-for-lunch-over-two-years-later><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Out For Lunch Over Two Years Later</span></h2><p>This pic was taken in 2017, and Mark Boone Jr., Ryan Hurst, and Charlie Hunnam were spending some free time together, visiting cafes in Hollywood. This was less than a month before the release of&nbsp;King Arthur (2017), in which Hunnam had a starring role. The timing is a hint that this lunch was a celebration, rather than just another hangout session.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lunch-once-again-almost-5-years-after-the-show><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lunch Once Again, Almost 5 Years&nbsp;After The Show</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Twitter post</a> uploaded by Charlie Hunnam in 2019 revealed that there is still a good relationship between himself, Ryan Hurst, Mark Boone Junior, and David Labrava, who have all been present at previous reunions. The team met up once more in Hollywood for this picture, so it is completely possible that, in between acting gigs, they have regular get-togethers.</p><p>SOURCES: Popculture.com, Celebrityinsider.org, Screencrush.com, Bleedingcool.com, Dailymail.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things The Women Of Sons Of Anarchy Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqKajYrynecCnmKubmK56or7EZquhnV2YrrTAjKacppqVp8Buv9Oio6Vllqe2prrDrGStp5SWxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
