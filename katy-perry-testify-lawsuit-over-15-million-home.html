However, the sale has been in dispute ever since the transaction was closed. Westcott now claims he wasn’t in the right mindset to complete the deal and never wanted to sell his estate in the first place.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/31550892787_ed9630b3c4_o1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Peek Inside Katy Perry's Jewelry Collection</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Superstar Katy Perry owns some of the world's finest jewels.</span><p>The seller claims he was diagnosed with Huntington’s Disease in 2015, which left him mentally incapacitated. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells</a> in the brain and is often accompanied by symptoms such as confusion, mood swings, depression, and trouble concentrating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Westcott now lives in a facility for dementia patients due to his deteriorating condition, but he’s continuing to fight Katy and Orlando for what he believes was an unlawful transaction.</p><p>Though it seems Katy will now have to appear in public for the non-jury trial to testify, her legal team initially tried to get the singer’s deposition to work instead. They also argued that getting her in-person for the trial would be difficult, since she’s traveling for work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a judge ruled that Katy will have to take the witness stand</a> in order for the trial to move forward, though she may be able to do so from a remote location. “I am inclined to have her do it remote, but I am not inclined to have a closed court,” the judge said, court documents reveal. “She is a person like anyone else. She is asking for a lot of money."</p><p>While Katy and Orlando may have to make a big payout if they come out on the losing side given the home’s multi-million dollar value (and potential damages they could be at fault for), the couple are actually hoping to secure their own million-dollar win.</p><p>In a countersuit, Katy is seeking over $5 million in damages due to loss of rental income as well as to cover the expenses she and Orlando have spent to rent other properties while the case has been ongoing.</p><p>Katy and Orlando have not commented on the most recent update from the lawsuit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpJmkrnqxsdGrsGaslajBqrLYZqOar6OqtrV5zq%2Bcq2VhanqutculoKimXZ28rrGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
