Their love story spans over 25 years, during which time Naomi has been more than just Bob’s romantic partner.&nbsp;</p><p>She has played a pivotal role in shaping his career and those of others in the industry. The couple’s union began in 1994 after they met at one of Bob’s comedy performances in West Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p>Naomi was immediately drawn to Bob’s comedic style and charisma; their connection was undeniable.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Naomi’s initial shyness, the two eventually became acquainted, and their <a href=#>relationship</a> quickly blossomed into a deep and enduring love.</p><p>Bob and Naomi’s love story is a testament to the power of true love and the importance of having a supportive and loving partner by one’s side.&nbsp;</p><p>Their enduring love and mutual respect for one another are truly inspiring, and their contributions to the entertainment industry have left an indelible mark.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bob Odenkrik children</h2><p>Bob and Naomi Odenkirk are the proud parents of two children – Nathan and Erin. The couple’s first child, Nathan, was born in December of 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>He has since gone on to pursue a career in acting and made his Hollywood debut in his father’s 2003 film Melvin Goes to Dinner. Nathan has also appeared in a TV mini-series titled Rat Bastard and the short film Scrub.</p><p>Erin, the couple’s second child, was born in 2000. Not much is publicly known about Erin, but both she and Nathan played a crucial role in Bob’s decision to accept the role of Saul Goodman in Better Call Saul.&nbsp;</p><p>Bob initially had reservations about taking the role, as he did not create or write the character and was concerned about the impact the extended filming schedule would have on his <a href=#>family</a> life.</p><p>&nbsp;However, Erin and Nathan encouraged their father to take the opportunity, ultimately convincing him to accept the gig.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Naomi Odenkirk</h2><p>Naomi Yomtov, who later became Naomi Odenkirk after marrying Bob in 1997, has been an integral part of the Hollywood entertainment scene for many years.</p><p>She began her career as an assistant at the William Morris talent agency, where she scouted new talent at comedy clubs across Los Angeles.</p><p>Her keen eye for emerging talent led her to represent several well-known actors and comedians, including Jenna Fischer, Kristen Wiig, <a href=#>Bill Hader</a>, Casey Wilson, and Derek Waters (both from Drunk History).</p><p>Naomi’s contribution to the industry extends beyond talent representation. She also played a critical role in the success of her husband’s career, serving as his manager for many years.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Bob admits that it wasn’t always easy working with his spouse.</p><p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he spoke about the challenges of having Naomi as his manager, saying<strong>, “In the case of Naomi, a really smart, informed person with a point of view … you want your wife or your partner to care about how it’s making you feel and not the thing itself.”</strong></p><p>Despite the challenges, Naomi and Bob eventually found a way to work together effectively. In an interview with Playboy, Naomi acknowledged that it took some time to figure out how to navigate their professional <a href=#>relationship</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“There were a few years where we hadn’t figured it out yet, and feelings would get hurt,”</strong> she said.</p><p>One of Naomi’s most significant achievements was discovering Bill Hader, whom she met when he was working as a production assistant on The Frank International Film Festival, a comedy short for the DVD release of Bob Odenkirk’s feature-length directorial debut, Melvin Goes to Dinner.&nbsp;</p><p>Naomi recognized Hader’s talent and began representing him, helping to launch his successful career in Hollywood.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCuzptkqJyVo7iqvspmrqKelWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
