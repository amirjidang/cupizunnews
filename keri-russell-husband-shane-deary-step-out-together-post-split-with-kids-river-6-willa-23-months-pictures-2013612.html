The same day the couple <a href=#>confirmed their separation</a>, they both emerged from their Brooklyn home together on Thursday, Dec. 5, to take their two young kids to school.</p><p>Americans actress Russell, 37, dressed in casual, comfortable layers — a pair of faded gray jeans below an oversized, hunter green sweater, and purple scarf wrapped around her neck — carried her baby girl <strong>Willa</strong>, 23 months, to the car. Russell’s daughter looked adorable in a pair of red printed pants tucked into her matching Hunter wellies, and a furry hat atop her head.</p><p>Deary, who joined his wife in the excursion, was dressed down in a utility jacket over a plaid shirt, and blue jeans. The handsome carpenter kept his head warm beneath a gray hat, as he guided Willa and 6-year-old son<strong> River</strong>, bundled up in a tan coat and chucks, to school. At one point, the trio huddled and stared inquisitively at cameras parked outside their home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>As the Felicity alum’s rep confirmed to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> on Thursday, Russell and Deary <a href=#>separated over the summer</a>. The two married on Valentine’s Day back in 2007.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I tend to think I can do everything myself,” Russell <a href=#>said in an interview</a> with Capitol File magazine for its holiday issue. “I don’t even like the word nanny, so I call them babysitters. Is that weird?” The former Mickey Mouse Club star also revealed that she and her hands-on husband have built a communal backyard with their neighbors in Brooklyn, so the kids can play together. “Shane, my husband, is a carpenter, and he built a secret garden gate so the three boys can visit and play together without going out the front door,” she said.</p><p>The affectionate mother of two also shared with the mag, “Christmas time gets more fun the older my kids get.” She continued, “In fact, I’ve been saving River’s Christmas lists. Last year he asked for a cheetah. Yes, a cheetah. That and a red T-shirt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknaKeerPB0qycpaRdncK0rsCnm2armJa7pnnDnpirsV2owaa8jKisrWWkpLSmwMeeqWaon6jBbr%2FPpaCtZaeewal5yqKbrGWinsOmvoxvZLChnKGubn6SZqSopqSdwG68yJyrrqqVqHpzfJBsbWpqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
