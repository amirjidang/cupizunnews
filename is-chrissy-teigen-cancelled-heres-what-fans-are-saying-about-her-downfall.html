Chrissy's very own texts have risen to the surface, portraying her in a very negative light, and unless her phone was taken over by someone else, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this sticky situation </a>might prove to be impossible to rise above.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans consider her to be canceled already and have turned against the star, while others believe that she still has an opportunity to redeem herself, if she takes her next steps very carefully.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Here's what fans have to say</a> about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Chrissy Teigen today</a>.</p><h2 id=she-s-creepy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She's Creepy</span></h2><p>Some of Chrissy Teigen's messages are downright creepy, and fans are calling her out on that very point. Now that her dirty laundry has been aired, many texts are rising to the surface that fans are deeming as being "creepy," and Teigen has yet to explain or make sense of them. Fans are now holding her accountable for some very questionable comments she has made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Stodden Reveals Shocking Allegations Against Chrissy Teigen</a></span></p><h2 id=her-true-colors-aren-t-pretty><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her True Colors Aren't Pretty</span></h2><p>Sadly, there has been a bubble burst where Chrissy Teigen's personality is concerned. Many of her fans know her best for her stunning swimwear photo shoots and her delectable cooking recipes. However, people are now seeing her true colors shine through, and fans are realizing that they just aren't as pretty as they had initially hoped.</p><h2 id=too-many-apologies-not-enough-change><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Too Many Apologies, Not Enough Change</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chrissy Teigen has gone from being silent, to issuing apologies for her poor choices. Initially, fans were relieved that she stepped up to the plate and said sorry for what she had done wrong. Now, it seems that she has mastered the art of issuing public apologies, and fans are no longer fooled. There are too many apologies and not enough change.</p><h2 id=she-s-not-good-enough-for-john-legend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She's Not Good Enough For John Legend</span></h2><p>John Legend's reputation is a pretty wholesome one, and he has seen great success in his life. His fans are cautioning him to separate himself from Teigen, as she is proving to have a negative impact on his life. Being married to Teigen and supportive of her behavior is now starting to reflect badly on Legend, and fans are urging him to separate from her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Demand 'The Voice' Cancel John Legend Over Chrissy Teigen's Behavior</a></span></p><h2 id=there-s-nowhere-to-hide><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>There's Nowhere To Hide</span></h2><p>Fans are considering canceling Teigen due to the fact that so much has been exposed, and they're saddened by the fact that she was hiding behind the facade of her air brushed social media. They are cautioning her that there is now nowhere to hide and urging her to not just come clean, but to better her behavior for good.</p><h2 id=she-s-worse-than-trump><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She's Worse Than Trump</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only are fans accusing Teigen of acting badly, but they're even going so far as to say that she's "worse than Trump." The parallel being drawn is clear. Donald Trump was kicked off of social media for poor choices laced with hatred and the same could happen to her. Many people, including the former President of the United States, have been officially canceled for lesser offenses, and fans remind Teigen the same could happen to her.</p><h2 id=she-s-sick-to-wish-death-on-people><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She's Sick To Wish Death On People</span></h2><p>Teigen's situation is far worse than cyber bullying. The mere fact that she is encouraging people to take their own lives suggests that she is sick and willing to take things far past the normal levels of criticism. Fans are not willing to accept that she wishes death upon people, at all. Many are suggesting she has a serious mental problem that requires interference by professionals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-departure-is-celebrated><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her Departure Is Celebrated</span></h2><p>When Chrissy Teigen is under fire, she tends to recoil and become reclusive. In defining moments that see her under the spotlight for wrongdoing, she seems to&nbsp;completely disappear from social media for long duration of time. Sadly, fans celebrate each time she falls off the grid, and many have commented that their social media posts are far less obtrusive when she is gone. When Chrissy takes a beak, fans feel this is a welcome change.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Even Cancel Culture Critics Want To Banish Chrissy Teigen</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-a-predator><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She's A Predator</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Chrissy Teigen does end up being officially canceled, fans are sending her a departing message. They want her to know that they consider her to be an absolute predator. Some celebrities have said things or acted in ways that are questionable, but Teigen's comments are targeted, and she's being dragged for being a predator, which is way worse on the scale of offenses.</p><h2 id=she-may-be-bullying-john-legend><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She May Be Bullying John Legend</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans have questioned the relationship between John Legend and Chrissy Teigen and are wondering if she is bullying him on a daily basis. For the fans who wonder why Legend is standing by her side and how he can defend his wife when she so blatantly revealed her true colors, the answer may be that he, himself, is being bullied. Teigen has demonstrated that she is authoritative and doesn't stop when it comes to pushing the envelope with her messaging. Some fans think John is being bullied by her, and that he may not even be able to recognize the problem since Teigen has such a firm grasp on him and treats him so badly.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leona Lewis Defends Chrissy Teigen As The Bullying Situation Gets Messier</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWTnb%2Bqv9KyZK2dmZyyr3nCmqWcnZyhsqV5x56pnqtdrLWiwIyfmKerXZa%2FpnnSmrCippdirqO71K1koZ2iYrGww82fmKWkXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
