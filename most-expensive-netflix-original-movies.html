But today, the service has extended to include streaming that now makes it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most popular mediums</a> for content to date. In addition to securing some of the most popular and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic films</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">television shows</a> in entertainment, the company has also gone on to fund its own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">original content</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Most Expensive Netflix Original Series Ever Made</a></span></p><p>This original content has included some of the most popular television shows of all time such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crown</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House of Cards</a>. Netflix isn't shy when it comes to providing a high budget for these shows either. The Crown averaged out at around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$130 million per season</a>. Stranger Things was estimated at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$103 million per season</a>. House of Cards was only shortly behind both at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million for the first two seasons</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But&nbsp;in addition to television, the curated platform has also funded&nbsp;several feature films as well. The successful indie sleeper Puffy Chair was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix's first original feature film</a>. It featured a budget of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just $15,000</a>. But since its&nbsp;premiere <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2005</a>, Netflix has continued to rise in popularity, allowing the company to allocate more funding for original content. This has resulted in some of the most innovative, stylistic, and popular films in cinema. Most of these films and their success are due to their expensive budget that has continued to increase over time. These investments have yielded a high return for Netflix, culminating in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over 203 million active users</a> as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several Academy Award nominations</a> for films such as The Irishman. Viewers continue to stay glued to their screens due for these original films. They are the most expensive in Netflix's original content.</p><h2 id=okja-50-million>Okja, $50 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This fantasy-inspired film helped introduce American audiences to the powerful directorial style of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bong Joon Ho</a> who would later go on to win <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Foreign Film</a> for his work on the film Parasite. The film premiered positively at its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cannes debut in 2017</a> and featured a star-studded cast that included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tilda Swinton</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven Yeun</a>.</p><h2 id=the-ridiculous-six-60-million>The Ridiculous Six, $60 million</h2><p>While still holding one of the highest production budgets in Netflix history, the feature was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive flop</a> that boasts an almost impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">0% on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The film received its budget in part due to its impressive cast list that featured comedic legends <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Terry Crews</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Schneider</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Wilson</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=project-power-85-million>Project Power, $85 million</h2><p>One of Netflix's first original features that fell into the superhero genre, this film was a result of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bidding war</a> for the screenplay that Netflix won for an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$85 million</a>. The film quickly became one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most streamed movies on the platform</a> during its initial weeks. It featured <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Foxx</a> teaming up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Gordon Levitt</a> and Dominique Fishback as the superheroes slowly take over the iconic setting of New Orleans.</p><h2 id=bright-90-million>Bright, $90 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While initially a flop, the film Bright went on to earn a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cult following</a> for its heavy subject matter and iconic cast. The fantasy plagued buddy-cop inspired movie cost <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$90 million</a> to make and despite the films reviews, it still remains one of the most streamed movies of the streaming services catalogue.</p><h2 id=triple-frontier-115-million>Triple Frontier, $115 million</h2><p>Venturing into the heist genre, this film was action packed and featured performances by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Isaac</a>, and Pedro Pascal. Serving as members of the US Army Delta Force, the film revolved around a plot to kidnap and rob a South American drug lord. The film has gone on to receive over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">63 million views</a> and retains <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a solid 71%</a> on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=outlaw-king-120-million>Outlaw King, $120 million</h2><p>A medieval war drama in the vein of Lord of the Rings, this ambitious film features a war waged by a Scottish King against King Edward I. Often compared to Braveheart, the two-hour epic starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pine</a> and Rebecca Robin. A majority of the films budget went to the elaborate special effects that resulted in some of the most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">realistic war scenes</a> to date.</p><h2 id=6-underground-150-million>6 Underground, $150 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This explosive-centric film was directed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Bay</a> which contributed to a majority of the films budget. It also featured two of the most iconic stars of the day: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melanie Laurent</a>. Revolving around an international group of assassins who plan to take down an Asian dictator, the film continued to support the hypothesis that heist films are the most successful venture for Netflix as this film is still one of the most streamed on the service.</p><h2 id=the-irishman-159-million>The Irishman, $159 million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This groundbreaking epic has a run time of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">3 hours and 29 minutes</a>. And even at the astonishing length, the film continues to grip people due to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">state of the art special effects</a> used to create the ultimate gangster masterpiece. The forefather of ganger cinema <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Scorsese</a> served as the director and he reunited with some of his most iconic collaborators including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert De Niro</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Pacino</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Pesci</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey Keitel</a>. The film was a commercial and critical success, earning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Academy Award nominations</a>.</p><h2 id=red-notice-160-million>Red Notice, $160 million</h2><p>Red Notice had a significant budget because of the team up and battle between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rock</a>. The&nbsp;action inspired comedy also featured recent superhero <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gal Gadot</a> who stars as the world's most elusive art thief. The action sequences combined with the stars in the film made this feature one of the most expensive in Netflix's history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-gray-man-200-million>The Gray Man, $200 million</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most expensive feature film for Netflix</a> has still yet to be released. Slated to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">begin filming in 2021</a> as th COVID-19 restrictions on production begin to loosen, the feature stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Evans</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling</a>. The film is supposedly set to launch a Netflix-based&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spy franchise</a> around the film and will be written and directed by the dynamic duo the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russo Brothers</a>. Fresh off the success of their superhero films <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Avengers: Infinity War</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Endgame</a>, the film will revolve around a former CIA operative hunting down another agent who has gone rogue. The film will be the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most expensive Netflix original to date</a> with a budget <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upwards of $200 million</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Expensive Movie Made: Pirates of the Caribbean "On Stranger Tides"</a></span></p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paste</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BusinessInsider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FilmDaily</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WeGotThisCovered</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GritDaily</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsOnNetflix</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YahooEntertainment</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YNA</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FoxBusiness</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Independent</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RottenTomatoes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HistoricalEnvironment</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicBook</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6sL%2FTZpyxqJWjwKrCxGalnqyWoba5ec6roKChnpa5brnOr6Ceq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
