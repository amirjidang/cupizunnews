Of course, there certainly have been some actors who’ve made it big after their first role, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Diaz did</a> after she starred in The Mask. However, the vast majority of stars that people think were overnight successes spent years working on their craft in anonymity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just as it is relatively rare for an actor to make it big all at once, a lot of people have it wrong with they think that most stars enjoy an extended time in the spotlight. Instead, a lot of actors who find the role of a lifetime will quickly find that people will forget about them before too long.</p><p>Back when the Twilight movies were raking in a fortune at the box office, Ashley Greene seemed poised to be the next big thing in Hollywood. Unfortunately for fans of Greene’s work, that hasn’t seemed to pan out. However, that doesn’t mean that Greene hasn’t done a lot of interesting things since the release of the last Twilight film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Movie Stars From the 2000s Who’ve Already Faded Away</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-s-rise-to-fame>Ashley’s Rise To Fame</h2><p>Born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida, when Ashley Greene was young she dreamed of making it big as a model. However, once Greene learned that the top models tend to be tall, she realized that the odds were against her making it in the fashion world since she stood at only five feet, five inches tall. Fortunately for Greene, it didn’t take her any time at all to pivot as she began to focus on starring in commercials instead.</p><p>In order to garner the most success as a commercial star, when Ashley Greene was young she began to take acting classes. That turned out to be a turning point in Greene’s life as she discovered that she truly loved acting and she decided to pursue it as a possible career. After Greene began to audition for roles, it didn’t take her long to find success as she began to appear in shows like Punk’d, Mad TV, and Crossing Jordan. In addition to Greene’s early television work, Greene wound up on the big screen for the first time when she landed a tiny role in an underrated 2007 film called King of California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year after Ashley Greene’s debut film was released, Twilight was released and it didn’t take long for moviegoers to take note of her work in the film. Cast as Alice Cullen, it could easily be argued that Greene’s character was the most likable supporting figure in the film and that was largely due to the innate goodness Ashley radiated in the role.</p><p>After most fans of the Twilight movies first took note of Ashley Greene’s standout performance in 2008’s Twilight, they continued to be impressed by her work in the rest of the series. As one of a select few actors who appeared in every one of the Twilight movies, it is hard to imagine the franchise without Greene’s contributions. After all, Greene was so delightful in the series that she was a breath of fresh air when things got serious. With that in mind, it makes sense that Greene made enough money from the Twilight films that she is among the series’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wealthiest actors</a> all of these years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How 'Twilight' Star Nikki Reed Amassed Her $12 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=ongoing-acting>Ongoing Acting</h2><p>From 2008 until 2012, five different Twilight films were released. As a result, Ashley Greene could rest assured that at least some of the movies she starred in during those years were very likely to be hits. In an obvious attempt to take advantage of the positive momentum the Twilight movies afforded her at that time, Greene starred in several other films during those years. Unfortunately for her, all of her non-Twilight movies that were released during those years failed to make much of an impact at the box office.</p><p>Even though Ashley Greene has mostly faded away from the spotlight since the release of the last Twilight movie, she has continued to find ongoing work. For example, since 2012 Greene has appeared in many movies including CBGB, Wish I Was Here, and most recently Bombshell. Additionally, Greene starred in the third and fourth season of the show Rogue and the web series, Step Up: High Water. Due to Greene’s role in the latter series, she is part of a series with a passionate fan base who care deeply about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their favorite characters</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Channing Tatum And Jenna Dewan Throwback Pics Too Sweet To Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=ashley-s-personal-life>Ashley’s Personal Life</h2><p>Since Ashley Greene rose to fame as an actor, it makes sense that people tend to focus on her career, However, if you want to look at everything that she has done since leaving Twilight behind, it would be foolish to ignore the other parts of her life.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJGzlpfJ0q8/</a></p><p>In terms of Ashley Greene’s personal life, the most notable thing that has come out in the press is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she married Paul Khoury</a> in 2018 during a ceremony that Robert Pattinson attended. While speaking about their life, Greene told US Weekly that they are “not having kids in the near-near future”. That said, Greene seems to be a planner as during that same interview she stated that she has begun to “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">implement certain things</a> into our lifestyle now” for when she does have kids. Additionally, Greene revealed that she has eliminated meat from her diet but she made it clear that she isn’t a vegan as she loves sushi “too much” and she still eats egg whites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Robert Pattinson Was Almost Fired From Twilight</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yaqqGkla56qL7EnqWeZZKasq951KlkraddqLavr8Rmq7ChnJ60qcCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
