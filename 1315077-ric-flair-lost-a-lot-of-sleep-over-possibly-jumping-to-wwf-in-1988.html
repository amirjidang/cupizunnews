It had nothing to do with going up there. I knew equally as many people up there. I’ve been lucky to have so many friends over the years in either company, and to this day, still do. I couldn’t leave the guys. It was an ego thing driven between me and Dusty [Rhodes] that happened almost every three months, and we’d work our way through it. It had nothing to do with the way anybody was treating me at that time. This was long before Jim Herd or Eric Bischoff came along. This was just an ego-driven decision.”</p><p>Flair would eventually sign with the WWF in August of 1991, appearing as “The Real World’s Champion.” …But what if he had signed 3 years earlier?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJqbGlvZ2K%2Fqq%2BMn6OaoaJiubC%2F02aYZqSfqXqwsoyso56doGK8t7HRZqeoq6Oer63FjKOspqiZo7RuwM5mrrCeXZ67bn2YcW8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
