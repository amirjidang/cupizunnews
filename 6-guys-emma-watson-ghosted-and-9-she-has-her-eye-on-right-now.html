However, when it comes to actually dating people, she’s incredibly picky and unlike celebs like Taylor Swift (who channels every single emotion about her breakup into hit tracks), Watson is extremely good, even annoyingly so, at keeping her relationships private and often refuses to discuss her boyfriend’s in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her decision to stay mum about the men in her life only makes the world more intrigued about who she spends her time with. However, her relationships that have gone public all seem to reveal one thing about Watson— she has a type. And her type may surprise even the most hardcore fans because they are not men you would typically think of her being with.</p><p>Below are six men who she has actually dated, or is at least rumored to have been with, and then nine others who have all the right makings to become "the one," if only she gave them a shot at love. Some of them&nbsp;are Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors, while others are not in the entertainment industry at all!</p><h2 id=over-romance-with-jay-barrymore-didn-t-work-out>Over: Romance With Jay Barrymore Didn’t Work Out</h2><p>Emma Watson and the British financier, Jay Barrymore, had a relatively short-lived romance because according to Zimbio, it began in July of 2009 and ended in March of 2010 (making the relationship roughly eight months).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their relationship, they were spotted in public together a few times and seemed to do very normal things, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grocery shopping at Waitrose</a> and cooking together (they reportedly bought Jamie Oliver's cookbook, Jamie’s Ministry of Food. However, it was obviously not meant to be and that could have been because they were in different places in their lives. Barrymore is reportedly seven years Watson’s senior, and she was also studying at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island while he was in England. Anyone who has ever done distance knows it’s not easy, especially if you’re a 19-year-old in college.</p><h2 id=over-she-fell-hard-for-british-rugby-player-matthew-janney>Over: She&nbsp;Fell Hard For British Rugby Player Matthew Janney</h2><p>Emma Watson and the British rugby player and Oxford University student, Matthew Janney, are reported to have dated for almost a year in 2014 (and even took a romantic trip to the Caribbean together), but according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, they&nbsp;were often apart because of their busy schedules. The publication also reported that their split was amicable and they “remained friends.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watson may not like to speak about her relationships and reveals very little to the press, but when she and Janney split she reportedly stated that it was a “horrendous time.” She made these comments in an interview with British <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, telling the publication, "I felt really uncomfortable, even before my relationship ended, I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself."</p><h2 id=over-she-even-starred-in-george-craig-s-music-video>Over: She Even Starred In George Craig’s Music Video</h2><p>Emma Watson and George Craig worked together on a fashion campaign for Burberry and are rumored to have got close during the shoot. They are alleged to have been romantically linked at some point in June of 2010 and were spotted together at Glastonbury Festival in England around that time.</p><p>Watson must really have liked Craig because she even agreed to star in the video for his band, One Night Only. She appeared in their single, "Say You Don't Want It,” and the pair looked very cozy laughing and walking around and dancing together on the streets of New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also spoke about him during an interview with UK's Radio 1 (Via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV News</a>). She said, "We’ve been friends since the Burberry shoot. And when I was in the states, George was taking me through a lot of his music as he was recording it. I couldn’t believe [how good the music was]. I’m a big fan. Everything he did was amazing."</p><h2 id=over-rafael-cebrian-was-a-college-lover>Over: Rafael Cebrian Was A College Lover</h2><p>Maybe it wasn't only long-distance that ended Emma Watson’s relationship with Jay Barrymore but also the fact that there were many eligible young men at Brown University who she could spend time with. And according to reports, Rafael Cebrian was one of those men.</p><p>Watson and the Spanish-born musician attended Brown University together and reportedly dated briefly from November of 2009, until May of 2010. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> source, at the time of her split from Barrymore, she was “heavily leaning of Rafael.” They continued, “Emma has been spending a lot of time with Rafael and they are virtually inseparable.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If this proves relationship proves anything it’s that there’s a bit of pattern with the men that Watson dates and she’s not only attracted to people who are interested in the arts, but also those who can challenge her intellectually.</p><h2 id=over-emma-and-william-mack-knight-were-all-smiles>Over: Emma And William Mack Knight Were All Smiles</h2><p>The most recent person Emma Watson was linked to was the tech entrepreneur, William Mack Knight, who was ten years her senior.</p><p>The pair were first spotted together in October of 2015, when they attended the Broadway musical Hamilton in New York City (which must have been a pretty phenomenal first date), and are rumored to have dated for two years before splitting in November of 2017. But what happened to end their romance?</p><p>That is a question that's hard to answer because Watson is notoriously private when it comes to her relationships. She previously told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> why she chose not to speak about her personal life, saying, "I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=over-it-was-teen-love-with-emma-watson-and-tom-ducker>Over: It Was Teen Love With Emma Watson And Tom Ducker</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who's Dated Who</a>, one of Emma Watson’s first public relationships was with Tom Ducker, who was also a rugby player (yes, there’s definitely a pattern here when it comes to the men she likes).</p><p>The pair reportedly first got together in 2006, but little is known about their romance. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Journal</a>, the pair met in Watson's hometown of Oxford, and during their romance, they reportedly holidayed in France where they were seen partying and having dinner dates.</p><p>At the time, one of the restaurant's owners reportedly revealed that the couple appeared to be very much in love, but it was young love because just over a year later there were reports that they had split, which is not that surprising, considering they were both just teenagers at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=potential-zac-efron-is-a-guy-who-could-make-her-laugh>Potential: Zac Efron Is A Guy Who Could Make Her Laugh</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Efron</a> is perhaps one of the most eligible bachelors in Hollywood, and despite being really, really good looking there is another reason why he would be a great match for Emma Watson. That reason is he has a fantastic sense of humor, something which he has proven time and time again in his comedic acting roles. And honestly, who doesn’t want a man who could make them laugh?</p><p>Apart from the ability to make someone laugh, Efron genuinely seems like one of Hollywood’s nicest guys; he doesn’t appear to take himself too seriously and is always seen with a smile on his face. It’s a pretty infectious smile, too.</p><p>On a side note, he has also proven that he can have committed, long-term relationships (he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dated Vanessa Hudgens for years</a>) and this is important when considering a future partner.</p><h2 id=potential-keanu-reeves-charitable-nature-makes-him-a-real-winner>Potential: Keanu Reeves’ Charitable Nature Makes Him A Real Winner</h2><p>Keanu Reeves is quite a bit older than Emma Watson, but she has proven with the men she has actually dated that age is but a number. Watson’s last boyfriend, William Mack Knight, was a good ten years older than her, so what’s another decade or so in the bigger scheme of things?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason Reeves would be a great boyfriend has nothing to do with his age though but more to do with his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charitable nature</a>. The greatest thing about Reeves is that he gives back without wanting any public attention or praise for his actions, and is legitimately just doing it because he cares. This is something that the pair both share; they care about others, and they want to make the world a better place. And this common interest could form the foundation of an incredible bond.</p><h2 id=potential-harry-styles-and-emma-watson-share-the-same-philosophies>Potential: Harry Styles And Emma Watson Share The Same Philosophies</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles</a> and Emma Watson together... stew over that thought for a hot minute. It’s a pretty good combination, right? And the reason these two could actually make a super cute couple is that firstly, they both became famous at a young age (Styles was 16 when he joined One Direction) so they understand the business. But the biggest reason they would make a great pair is really because they have similar interests and Styles is a proud feminist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If he’s not wearing shirts with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strong messages about females</a>, then he’s making feminist statements in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>. He previously said, "Music is something that's always changing. There's no goal posts. Young girls like the Beatles. You gonna tell me they're not serious? How can you say young girls don't get it? They're our future. Our future doctors, lawyers, mothers, presidents, they kind of keep the world going."</p><p>Anyone who knows anything about Watson will know that she’s passionate about gender equality and it would be important for her to be with a man who understood that.</p><h2 id=potential-who-doesn-t-love-a-man-with-style-like-taron-egerton>Potential: Who Doesn’t Love A Man With Style Like Taron Egerton?</h2><p>You may remember Taron Egerton from Kingsman: The Secret Service? Anyway,&nbsp;he’s one of the rising British stars at the moment and also supports females in the industry, or at least the remakes of films with an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all-female cast</a> (what a keeper).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s 28, so he’s pretty close in age to Emma Watson who is 27, and while age in a relationship doesn’t necessarily mean anything, the closer you are in age usually suggests you are at the same place in your life and want the same things. Also, these two would look insanely cute together because who doesn’t want to be with a man who is a snazzy dresser? Egerton is definitely that, and he looks so good in a suit that GQ actually decided he deserved a spot on their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 best-dressed British men</a> of 2015 list.</p><h2 id=potential-rupert-grint-was-her-harry-potter-lover>Potential: Rupert Grint Was Her 'Harry Potter' Lover</h2><p>Why should Emma Watson date <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rupert Grint</a>? Well, out of all the men who find their names on this list, this is probably the most obvious one, and the reason is that Grint&nbsp;and Watson were once co-stars on Harry Potter.</p><p>The pair were only children when they starred in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone back in 2011 (the first film of the franchise), so they basically grew up together, but also had to deal with the intense media scrutiny that came with their newfound fame. And if ever Watson wanted to be with someone who could relate to her, it would be Grint.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, they’ve already proven how adorable they were as a wizard couple, which makes me think they’d be just as good in real life.&nbsp;And don’t all the best relationships start off as friendships? Because if this is true then these two already have that covered.</p><h2 id=potential-tom-hiddleston-has-publicly-praised-emma-watson>Potential: Tom Hiddleston Has Publicly Praised Emma Watson</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hiddleston</a>’s most famous relationship was probably with Taylor Swift and it was a little weird how public they made it. However, that relationship didn’t work out (actually it came to a rather abrupt end) which is actually perfect because now Emma Watson and Hiddleston have their shot at love.</p><p>You may not have realized, but Watson and Hiddleston actually know each other, which is a good starting point. And that’s not all, Hiddleston has also shown his support for Watson and the causes she’s passionate about. He did this in 2014 by sharing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo of himself</a> on social media, holding up a sign for the HeForShe campaign, and praising her for being “impeccable & extraordinary.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oh, and Hiddleston is British, and Watson seems to have a thing for her countrymen.</p><h2 id=potential-alex-roe-shares-a-common-interest-with-her>Potential: Alex Roe Shares A Common Interest With Her</h2><p>Looking at the photo of the British actor, Alex Roe, you can immediately tell why he and Emma Watson would make a fantastic couple but looks aside, these two would be an interesting fit for another reason— they share a similar approach when it comes to people in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Watson once said during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle Australia</a>, “I don't date people who are famous, and I don't think it's fair that all of a sudden, intimate details of their personal life are public as a direct result of me.” Although if she was ever to see this list, she may reconsider her thoughts.</p><p>The interesting thing about Roe is he also doesn’t like to rub shoulders with famous people and is quoted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Standard</a> as saying, “I try to avoid being friends with actors…” Could this mutual dislike be a starting point?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=potential-owen-farrell-is-a-handsome-and-talented-rugby-player>Potential: Owen Farrell Is A Handsome And Talented Rugby Player</h2><p>Unless you’re a rugby fan, you probably have no idea who Owen Farrell is, so let me explain— he is a really good looking and talented British rugby star. Farrell is only 26, and the reason his name has found its way onto this list (apart from his devilishly handsome grin) is that Emma Watson has a bit of a history when it comes to dating rugby players.</p><p>Her ex-boyfriend, Tom Ducker, was a rugby player, and so was Matthew Janney. Janney was an Oxford University rugby player, and Watson seemed pretty smitten with him, and although there are not too many comparisons we can make between Janney and Farrell, the most obvious is their love of the sport. And as far as rugby goes Farrell would be a step-up because he’s a professional rugby union player, and looks set to become a captain for England in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=potential-prince-harry-could-have-been-the-one-but-she-missed-her-chance>Potential: Prince Harry Could Have Been 'The One' But She Missed Her Chance</h2><p>No one will be crying over this one because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Harry</a> and Meghan Markle are absolutely adorable together and the world cannot wait for their fast-approaching wedding day. However, if you think about Harry before he met the love of his life, you have to admit that he and Emma Watson could have made the most adorable couple. And in 2015, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there were even rumors</a> suggesting that they could be a couple.</p><p>Following Watson’s split from her British rugby player boyfriend, Matthew Janney, Woman’s Day claimed that Watson and the Prince were having "secret dates," and it seemed that the world wanted this to be true so badly that the actress even had to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take to Twitter</a> to dispel the rumors (and she’s not one for really tweeting about her personal life). Sure, Prince Harry has another actress he’s engaged to now, but these two definitely missed their shot at love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nZmK0tsXSZpympZFixKLA0qilZp%2BYpMC1scNmmKecXW56tLTEZp%2Baq12dsrN5xLKcZqeeYr%2Bqs8etZKenp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
