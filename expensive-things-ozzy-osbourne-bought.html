Having no issues in splashing the cash that he has earned from touring the world throughout his life, Ozzy has spent a lot of money. Within this list, we will take a look at what the rock and roll legend has spent his money on.</p><h2 id=alcohol>Alcohol</h2><p>Something that Ozzy Osbourne has done plenty of throughout his lifetime is&nbsp;drink alcohol. It's something that has caused a ton of ups and downs throughout his life, but it is something he has done a lot of.</p><p>Ozzy might be sober now, but throughout the peak of his career as he toured the world, Ozzy certainly dabbled in drinking as much as possible. It was part of the rock and roll lifestyle back in the day, and there's no doubt that he has spent an absolute fortune on it throughout his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fireworks>Fireworks</h2><p>Many people enjoy purchasing fireworks during their lifetimes, whether it be for New Year's Eve, Bonfire Night, or any other major celebration. However, most normal people don't spend hundreds of thousands on them.&nbsp;One classic story about Osbourne just so happens to involve fireworks, and spending a lot of money on them.</p><p>The Englishman was once arrested after setting fireworks off in the hallway of a hotel while on tour. Osbourne spent a fortune on the fireworks, and the destruction that he caused within the hotel ended up costing him. Ozzy spent a reported $200,000 after this incident when all was said and done, making this a very expensive prank.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest Paid Rock Star Musicians To Date</a></span></p><h2 id=hotel-carnage>Hotel Carnage</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p>Destroying things inside hotels wasn't a one-off situation for Ozzy Osbourne when he decided to host a firework party indoors. During a stay at the Four Seasons, Ozzy made the decision to launch the television outside of the window. The reasoning behind it was simply that he was bored, and he promptly threw it out, not even thinking that there could be someone below.</p><p>Thankfully, nobody was hurt in the incident, apart from Ozzy's bank balance. Of course, the hotel forced him to pay up for a new television, window, and damage to the floor outside. But they also charged him three months' worth of time for the room, running him a bill of over $40,000.</p><h2 id=tattoos>Tattoos</h2><p>When people think about the rock and roll image, tattoos are often a major part of that, and Ozzy Osbourne certainly has plenty of them. Throughout his lifetime, the rock legend has added more and more, creating a unique look for himself.</p><p>While Ozzy actually did a lot of the tattoos himself, including the one on his knuckles that say 'Ozzy,' just as many have been done professionally by some amazing artists. Of course, high-quality tattoos don't exactly come cheaply, and when you have an entire body full of them the bill starts to grow quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Richest Rock Bands, Ranked</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=family-issues>Family Issues</h2><p>Sharon's family does not get along with Ozzy's, and that's an issue that dates back years. In fact, it goes all the way back to when they first got married. He gave Sharon the Black Sabbath contract when they were married, and she took it to an American label, rather than giving it to her father, who had previously been in charge.</p><p>Her father didn't take things sitting down though and he went out of his way to sue the Osbournes. Despite the fact they were family, her father sued them for $1 million in damages.</p><h2 id=tax-debt>Tax Debt</h2><p>An issue that seems to plague countless celebrities is their inability to pay their taxes, and the Osbourne family was no different in that regards. The family failed to keep up with their taxes in the past and it led to a major debt for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, they did end up paying it, but the debt they racked up ended at over $1 million, making this a very expensive mistake to make. Sharon ended up coming out and accepting responsibility for the debt, but it was no doubt something that they both paid back together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Rock Stars Of 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=car-collection>Car Collection</h2><p>Ozzy Osbourne is a major petrol head and throughout his life, he grew an impressive car collection, worth a reported $800,000. Ozzy had a vast variety of cars, from sports cars to vintage vehicles. However, the emphasis is on *had,* as his wife, Sharon Osbourne, actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold</a>&nbsp;his entire collection as a punishment for him.</p><p>When he fell off the wagon, Sharon made the decision to punish him by selling all those cars as a lesson for him not to do it again. Also, giving him an excuse to go and purchase a bunch more vehicles, adding to this expensive habit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drugs>Drugs</h2><p>Something that Ozzy Osbourne is incredibly well known for is his drink, drugs, and party lifestyle. Drugs are something that dominated the rock and roll scene and Ozzy certainly dabbled within it. There are countless stories about the totally insane things Ozzy decided to do under the influence, and he has spoken very openly about his history with drugs during interviews.</p><p>Because Ozzy was one of the biggest names in the world of rock and roll, the decisions he made became incredibly well known. It is because of that, everyone knows that he spent an absolute fortune on drugs throughout his life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Prescription Drugs</a></span></p><h2 id=mansion>Mansion</h2><p>Of course, if you're going to live a lavish rock and roll lifestyle, you've got to have a huge mansion to go along with it. Unsurprisingly, the Osbourne family home wasn't a cheap one for him to buy. Ozzy spent a fortune on the property, which is located in Beverly Hills and was recently put up for sale, at the small asking price of $28 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who knows how much Ozzy actually spent on the property, but the cost will certainly be in the millions, to say the least. This is one of the most expensive purchases of his career, but at least it is one that will have had plenty of use.</p><h2 id=uk-home>UK Home</h2><p>Their lavish property in Beverly Hills isn't the only property that they own though. With both Sharon and Ozzy being English, it is no surprise that they actually also own a property in the U.K. as well.</p><p>They have two main houses and even owned property in Malibu for a period of time as well. Clearly, real estate is something that they are very happy to pay a price for, so it's a good&nbsp;thing he had a very successful career.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Silver and Gold: 10 Richest Female Country Singers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSyubzEp6qirpViwam1zaCqZqeqr8Zuu9Kbpq6qnpp6o7vUoJ%2BtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
