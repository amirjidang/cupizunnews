But there is much more to Gosling, including his troubled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">childhood</a>, which coincides with his childhood nickname, 'Trouble.'

He said,&nbsp;"I was always picking fights. Because I thought that was what the girls would like. I'd pick on the toughest guys because the girls liked them. So if I beat them up, the girls would like me. But it never worked." It's a little hard to believe that Gosling wasn't always the heartthrob that fans admire now, but between his parents' divorce and his bad behavior in school, he struggled emotionally and physically during crucial years of development. With all of this, Gosling said, "I was just in so much trouble. They called me 'Trouble'; that was my nickname."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a different interview with the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a>, the 39-year-old told about how he used to get bullied and beat up at school, but he eventually had enough of it.&nbsp;"I walked into school. Everything got really quiet. I found one of the kids in front of a urinal. I smacked his face into the tile, and he bled. The other kid was at his desk. I picked up a math textbook and made his nose bleed. I didn't want to do it. I don't like violence. I never went back to that school again." Unfortunately, he "was very lost" in his younger years and had some difficulty finding his way. He goes on to explain,&nbsp;"I didn't play sports. I couldn't read or write. I was a brat, always in trouble. My teachers thought I was stupid. So did I." With little support and direction, Gosling was dubbed, 'Trouble,' named after his troubling behavior.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Ryan Gosling "Hey Girl" Memes That Will Seriously Uplift You</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-co-star-can-attest-to-ryan-gosling-s-bad-behavior>This Co-Star Can Attest To Ryan Gosling's Bad Behavior</h2><p>During a past episode of The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Timberlake shared</a> about his friendship with Gosling when they were working together on Mickey Mouse Club. The pop-singer shared,&nbsp;"We used to do terrible things. We thought we were so cool. Looking back on them, they weren't as bad as I thought they were at the time. We stole a golf cart. And we were like, 'Yeah, man. We're stealing a golf cart!" And in another story, he reminisced on when,&nbsp;"We drove into MGM Studios, which is totally illegal by the way. I was like, 'What do you want to do thug?' And Ryan was like, 'I don't know,' cuz...because that's definitely how we talked."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling Was Almost A Backstreet Boy...

When Gosling started to focus his time and energy on developing himself as a respectable actor, having a goal to work towards helped him immensely. Gosling's talents can be admired in La La Land, The Big Short, Remember the Titans, and more iconic films and television shows.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Crazy Things You Never Knew About Ryan Gosling</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmqbKZnmK0sL%2FLoqWgq12Ytaq4w6GmqJxdo7akt82apJ5lp5bAbsDRqKybpJVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
