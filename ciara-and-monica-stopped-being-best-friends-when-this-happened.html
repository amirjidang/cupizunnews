But that all changed when rapper Future started dating the Promise singer-songwriter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who would dump her ex</a> shortly after learning he had allegedly cheated on her.</p><p>She's since settled down with NFL player Russell Wilson; they share two children together, Win and Sienna. But splitting with Future also meant Ciara would keep her distance from Monica, but how exactly was the latter dragged into the drama, and have these two spoken since going their separate ways?</p><h2 id=was-future-to-blame-for-monica-and-ciara-s-feud>Was Future To Blame For Monica And Ciara's Feud?</h2><p>Just three months after giving birth to their son, Future Jr., Ciara announced her split with the I Got The Keys hip hop star in August 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There had been a string of allegations made against Future, with insiders claiming he had been cheating on Ciara throughout her pregnancy, which simply wasn’t something that she could overlook — particularly since the pair were planning ahead of their wedding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciara Celebrates Natalia Bryant’s 18th Birthday With A Dance, And Vanessa Loves It</a></span></p><p>CiCi&nbsp;was absolutely distraught about the breakup, which she later admitted in an interview on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Table Talk</a> in June 2019. “I’d have moments when I would be in the shower, I’d be crying,” she said. “I&nbsp;had a few different settings — crying in the bedroom, crying in the shower … crying because I’m not in the happiest place, and it hurts what I’m going through.”</p><p>“I grew up with my mom and dad being together, the idea of it being, ‘Mommy and Daddy made baby,’ then all of a sudden you’re living your life in front of the world. That adds a whole ‘nother layer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following their split in 2014, it was rumored that one of the girls Future had been hooking up with behind Ciara’s back with Brittni, who he appeared to have rekindled with while giving the 1, 2 Step artist the impression he was being faithful when he said he was flying abroad for business.</p><p>Instead, he was allegedly still intimate with his ex. Here’s where Monica comes in.</p><p>The 40-year-old reportedly shared close ties with Brittni, according to Straight From The A, and Ciara certainly wasn’t happy about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Does Cardi B And Kylie Jenner’s Hair Stylist Charge For His Wigs?</a></span></p><p>Being friends with someone who’s responsible for your relationship downfall after welcoming a baby was all too much for her, so she subsequently decided to take a break from her friendship with Monica. They stopped talking, but in September 2014, Ciara wrote a shady tweet, which many believed was aimed at her former BFF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Some people be preaching to people, but be the most crooked. #ColdWorld,” she wrote.</p><p>Monica got word of the reports going around that she was said to have been friends with Brittni all while she was supposed to have Ciara’s back.</p><p>The situation definitely didn’t put her in a good light, so in an effort to clear her name from the drama, Monica came forward and insisted that there was no truth to her sharing a friendship with any of Future’s exes — other than Ciara — and that people shouldn’t believe everything they read online.</p><p>“They say I was friends with somebody he was cheating with, none of that stuff is true. I AM friends with one of the mothers of one of Future's children, but it's the mom that you never see, you never hear, that Ciara also has a good relationship with.</p><p>“So a lot of the stuff you read is very untrue. Nothing that happened with us had anything to do with him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Did Cardi B And Bruno Mars Spend On Their ‘Please Me’ Music Video?</a></span></p><p>The following year, however, Monica admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there had been a rift between her and Ciara</a>, causing the pair to lose contact for some time, but she wouldn’t reveal whether the feud was over an issue related to Future or not.</p><p>“She and I did have a disagreement,” the Everything To Me songstress told Streetz 94.5’s The Jazzy Mcbee Show. “We both had issues with each other. When you have been friends for a long time, almost two decades, and you let things fester and you don't talk about them, it can cause a breakdown that other people may not understand.”</p><p>In February 2019, Ciara took to social media to post a selfie of her and Monica at the Super Bowl, which heavily insinuated that any issues the two had in the past had been squashed.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Wilson Shares An Impactful Video Tribute To The Late Kobe Bryant And Daughter Gigi</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaopmilnqiusNmpKimmZiubr%2FTqKepnZRir6a1zaBkm52jqXqnvsiepZ2rXay1prqMrZ%2Biq12drrG8xKecnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
