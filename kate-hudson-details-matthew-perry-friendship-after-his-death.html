“We played tennis and played more tennis, talked endlessly about trials and tribulations of love and then would talk some more as we would laugh our asses off and then laughed some more,” Hudson, 44, wrote via her Instagram Story on Monday, October 30. “I share the same sadness with all our film and TV community who shared time with Matthew."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the snap, Hudson let out a big laugh, presumably in response to something Perry had said.</p><p>“As you can see, to know him was to adore him,” Hudson continued. “I send my love and condolences to his family and his work families.

He was 54.</p><p>There were no signs of foul play at the scene, but the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner said that <a href=#>Perry’s cause of death</a> has been “deferred” following <a href=#>the initial autopsy</a>. A toxicology report is still pending.</p><p>The Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed on Monday, October 30, that <a href=#>Perry was already deceased</a> when first responders arrived at the scene. “A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” a spokesperson for the LAFD told CNN in a statement. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”</p><p>LAFD spokesperson <strong>Nicholas Prange</strong>, meanwhile, told Page Six that firefighters “didn’t perform CPR” on Perry after arriving at his residence “because he was already beyond medical help.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days after Perry’s death, his former <a href=#>Friends</a> costars — <a href=#><strong>Lisa Kudrow</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Matt LeBlanc</strong></a> — paid tribute to the actor <a href=#>in a joint statement</a>.
