Dern opened up about her 1999 split from Thornton – when he famously left her for&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong></a>&nbsp;– &nbsp;during a past interview with&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;magazine. “I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I’ve never heard from him again,” she said, via&nbsp;ABC News. “It’s like a sudden death.
