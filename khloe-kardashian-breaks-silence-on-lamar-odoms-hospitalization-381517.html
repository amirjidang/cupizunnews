But after reports spotted many of the family members, including <a href=# id=auto-tag_kris-jenner_2 data-tag=kris-jenner>Kris Jenner</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_kim-kardashian_2 data-tag=kim-kardashian>Kim Kardashian</a>-West rushing to his side, Khloe made a more public announcement regarding her estranged husband.</p><p>The reality star&nbsp;announced that the family will “hold off” on publishing content from their apps while they continue to “pray and support” Odom&nbsp;during this sensitive time. The well-known&nbsp;sisters, with the exception of Kourtney Kardashian, launched their individual outlets&nbsp;on Apple’s app&nbsp;store in September, which allows fans to get an exclusive look at their day-to-day routines.</p><p>Although Lamar and Khloe’s relationship was never publicized on the new app, the former couple were featured on E!’s&nbsp;Keeping Up With The Kardashians, as well as getting their own spinoff, Khloe & Lamar. After getting married in secret only a month after knowing each other, they seemed like the most stable couple.&nbsp;However, in both docu-series, the couple struggled with a failed pregnancy and other marital issues. It was also revealed that Odom had a troubled past, dealing with drug abuse. The couple split in 2013.</p><p>The two have been estranged for quite some time, as Khloe has been spotted dating rapper <a href=# id=auto-tag_french-montana_2 data-tag=french-montana>French Montana</a> and currently, NBA player <a href=# id=auto-tag_james-harden_2 data-tag=james-harden>James Harden</a>. But that didn’t stop her from joining her family at Lamar’s bedside. Many of the family members have supported Khloe’s announcement by putting up the same post on their account. They&nbsp;have also posted pictures showing their love for Lamar as well as stating that they are praying for his recovery.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i60.tinypic.com/efhz7d.jpg border=0 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C1rbvEZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkm6qVlri0edKio56mk5p6sLqMpZimmaJivKW7zKxkoaejpba1rcuisZqsmaS7bn%2BXamxqb18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
