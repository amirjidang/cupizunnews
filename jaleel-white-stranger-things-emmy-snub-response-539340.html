Somehow our youth doesn’t get honored; our youth just gets hazed.”</p><p>He continued by saying adult actors have to deflate their egos enough to let the newer generation get their shine at the present time. “They feel so entitled to the accolade they’ve probably worked for their entire career, that it’s offensive to them almost that someone so young, who hasn’t been through [their] journey, beat [them] for that award,” he continues. “And I just think that’s the wrong attitude to look at it. For directors and producers, you’re not going to get competent performers on your set if they didn’t start at a young age and understand professionalism.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurbHEpWSwoJmpsm6%2F06uYp5%2BVp3q1tMinnqxllaK6unnSp6ybZaKawLG7zaycZm1jboB1fI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
