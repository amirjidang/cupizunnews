Fans started to speculate in April that their onscreen personas were bleeding into real life when Powell, 35, and Sweeney, 26, <a href=#>cozied up in photos</a> that quickly went viral.</p><p>While Powell noted that he had “a wonderful journey” with Sweeney when making the film, heightening their real-life relationship to promote the movie proved to be challenging for the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Glen-Powell-Seemingly-Dubs-Sydney-Sweeney-as-the-Mastermind-Behind-Anyone-But-You-Dating-Rumors2.jpg><p>“The only reason it made things harder for me to lean into that stuff was that I was going through a very real breakup amidst a promotional tour,” he explained. “I was with someone that I really loved and cared about and was trying to kind of make sense of a lot of stuff.”</p><p>He continued, “It was a lot easier for Sydney to lean into something like that because she’s in a very committed and wonderful relationship and she’s very happy. So it was a little harder for me.”</p><p>Powell was referring to his split from girlfriend of three years <strong>Gigi Paris</strong>. As photos of Powell and Sweeney cozying up on set were shared online, Us Weekly confirmed that Paris, 31, <a href=#>unfollowed him</a> on Instagram. Later that month, multiple outlets confirmed that Powell and Paris <a href=#>had split</a>.</p><p>Sweeney, for her part, has been <a href=#>in a relationship</a> with <strong>Jonathan Davino</strong> since 2018. Us confirmed in March 2022 that the two were engaged. Davino produced Anyone But You alongside Sweeney.</p><p>All things considered, Powell did praise Sweeney’s “impressive sense of marketing,” noting that she knows “what is new and fresh and cool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Glen-Powell-Seemingly-Dubs-Sydney-Sweeney-as-the-Mastermind-Behind-Anyone-But-You-Dating-Rumors1.jpg><p>Would the Top Gun: Maverick star work with her again?</p><p>“In a heartbeat,” he said.</p><p>Anyone But You was released earlier this month, but it feels like Powell and Sweeney have been dodging <a href=#>real-life dating rumors</a> for the better part of a year.</p><p>“It’s a rom-com, that’s what people want!” Sweeney told Variety in August, <a href=#>breaking her silence</a> on the speculation about her status with Powell.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>It took months for Powell to first address the “alleged affair.” He spoke <a href=#>candidly about the aftermath</a> of the rumors in his November Men’s Health cover story.</p><p>“When all that stuff happened, you know, publicly, it felt disorienting and unfair,” he explained. “But what I’m realizing is that’s just a part of this gig now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagpJWjerG71p6jpWWXnsOmv4yssJ2mla56tMPEnqWesV2Yv6awyK1kn6eiYrGiwMinnmaqpaK8s7%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
