While some famous people really are too busy to dedicate time to shows like The Real Housewives&nbsp;franchise, The Bachelor, or Dance Moms, other stars revel in that kind of entertainment. Some even turn into huge fangirls when they meet <a href=#>reality stars</a> in real life!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Female Singers In 2019</a></span></p><p>And we’re sure there are lots of famous people out there who do enjoy reality TV, but their publicists have told them not to admit it! Keep reading to find out which celebrities love, and have admitted to loving, reality TV.</p><h2 id=rihanna>Rihanna</h2><p>Just because she’s one of the world’s biggest superstars doesn’t mean <a href=#>Rihanna</a> doesn’t have a little time for reality television. In fact, that’s exactly how the Bajan singer winds down after a hectic day of touring. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Style Caster</a>, she loves nothing more than bingeing on Love and Hip Hop, Bad Girls Club, and most of all, Shahs of Sunset.</p><p>“You forget about TV when you’re working, but it has been saving my life any time I get back to my hotel room,” she confessed in an interview with Grazia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-redmayne>Eddie Redmayne</h2><p>Some celebrities give us reality TV vibes, but Eddie Redmayne is not that kind of star. In fact, he’s the last person you’d probably expect to watch reality television in his spare time. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Magazine</a>&nbsp;reveals that he’s actually a closeted fan of faux-reality TV and has been since The Hills&nbsp;aired.</p><p>“I come home from trying to pretend to know about astronomy and physics all day and turn on The Real Housewives … I can’t believe the intricacies of their lives,” he said during the filming of his blockbuster hit The Theory of Everything.</p><h2 id=chrissy-teigen>Chrissy Teigen</h2><p>One celebrity we did have inkling was addicted to reality TV is Chrissy Teigen. The model’s social media posts do kind of give her away sometimes! She is always tweeting about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Housewives</a> franchise and is never afraid to fan-girl hard for the ladies when she meets them in real life.</p><p>You might have guessed that Teigen even has her own Housewives <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tagline</a> that she’s created for herself: “I may be married to John, but I’m a Legend in my own right.” Maybe she’ll find herself on the show in the not-too-distant future!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-pratt>Chris Pratt</h2><p>Since he’s been spending time in the United Kingdom, Chris Pratt has become a sucker for British reality television in particular. He admitted to Graham Norton that he is now a fan of the classic show The Only Way Is Essex.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Disney Parks: 10 Male Celebrities You Didn't Know Worked At Disney Before They Were Famous</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV UK</a>, Pratt always watched the show with his wife when they were in the UK because he was filming Guardians of the Galaxy. “She fell in love with the show and I started picking up the accent so now the only British one I can do is an Essex one.”</p><h2 id=solange-knowles>Solange Knowles</h2><p>Most people watch reality television to temporarily escape from their lives, but Solange Knowles does the opposite. She watches shows like The Real Housewives&nbsp;because they remind her of home and, well, bring her back to reality.</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Knowles explained that&nbsp;The Real Housewives&nbsp;is particularly close to her heart, as it brings her back to her childhood in Houston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p>We might have known that Jennifer Lawrence was a sucker for reality television! She might be one of the busiest A-listers in the business, but every now and then, she still fits in time for a few sessions of Shark Tank, Dance Moms, and The Real Housewives.</p><p>Lawrence&nbsp;even confessed in one interview (via Style Caster) that she wanted to end up with someone who had the same taste in reality TV, and someone who would watch TV with her. That’s not a bad requirement to have!</p><h2 id=diddy>Diddy</h2><p>We can’t really imagine Diddy being a hardcore reality TV fan, but, apparently, he is. Out of all the shows, his favorite is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives</a>, particularly Atlanta and New Jersey. Not only does Diddy watch the shows religiously, but he also follows them afterward&nbsp;by going into chat rooms and talking with other fans.</p><p>“My favorite housewife, hands down, is Nene [Leakes],” he told E! News in an interview (via People). Diddy is mostly an Atlanta housewife fan and enjoys the family feud angle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</h2><p>Here’s another one we probably could have guessed! Taylor Swift isn’t just one of the most successful pop stars of the age, she’s also an avid watcher of reality TV and isn’t afraid to admit it. But unlike her fellow celebrities, she’s not really into classic shows like The Real Housewives&nbsp;or even The Bachelor. One of her favorites is actually Couples Therapy with Dr. Jenn, which airs on VH1.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Clean Living: 10 Celebrities You Didn't Know Were Living Sober</a></span></p><p>Seeing as she loves baking so much, Swift is also a huge fan of the UK show, The Great British Bake Off.</p><h2 id=louis-tomlinson>Louis Tomlinson</h2><p>If Louis Tomlinson’s tweets are anything to go by, it’s safe to say that this guy loves his Celebrity Big Brother. We don’t know whether or not he’s addicted to any other reality TV shows, but the former One Direction star has been known to passionately tweet about the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Must admit I’m loving celeb big brother!” he said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one tweet</a>. Perhaps we might see Tomlinson himself enter the Big Brother&nbsp;house one day? Somehow, we feel like that would rake in quite a few (million) tween viewers. Only time will tell!</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson>Robert Pattinson</h2><p>Twilight actor Robert Pattinson loves to chill out and get away from the craziness of being a celebrity by watching reality TV in his native England. According to MTV UK, he is a huge fan of English reality shows, such as Geordie Shore.</p><p>“It’s like the Jersey Shore of England,” he revealed in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>. “It’s amazing, one of the greatest TV shows I have ever seen in my entire life.” Pattinson went on to say that he doesn’t like shows where the audience just mocks people. He likes shows like Geordie Shore because he ends up really liking the cast.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Get Out Of My Face: 10 Celebrities Who Hate The Paparazzi</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nk5q5pq7RoquinaNiubDCxGaumqyTnbavs4yrnJqkmanGbsDVaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
