The majority of affiliate marketers who have been doing this for a while have their own set of preferred networks and usually get higher payouts without any issues. However new affiliates and ad networks are going live for the first time everyday. The same holds true for different affiliate offers.</p><p>Whenever I see a new offer popup on a network that I think I can push some volume on, I like to see how many other networks have the offer available and what their payouts are. If this is something you aren’t currently monitoring than you could be getting burned for a lot of money!</p><p>On example is for a game related offer I have been pushing some nice volume on lately. One network has a payout for the offer in the $1.25 range, while another network is paying me over $1.75 per lead! With just 100 leads per day, this equates to a difference between $1500 just for not knowing that the offer is available at a higher price from another network!</p><p>There are lots of ways to check payouts on offers, such as logging into all of your affiliate accounts and looking them up manually… but there is actually a better solution. That solution is using affiliate payout search engine sites. I’ve listed a bunch of the top resource sites for you below.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Affplus.com</a> is one of the largest and best directories out there for searching through affiliate offers. You also have some great sorting options on the left side of the page.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async alt="AffPlus Affiliate Search" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AffPlus-Affiliate-Search.jpg width=635 height=266 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>OfferVault.com</a> is another affiliate offer comparison site that you should be adding to your resources arsenal.</p><p><img decoding=async alt=OfferVault src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/OfferVault.jpg width=635 height=353 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">oDigger.com</a> is another great site for comparing the different affiliate offers and rates out there.

You can see their directory site at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PeerFlyOffers.com</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="PeerFly Offers" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PeerFly-Offers.jpg width=635 height=379 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The next time you are setting up an ad campaign to promote an affiliate offer, be sure to make sure you are getting the highest payout. Once you start pushing some nice volume don’t forget to go back to the network and try to get a higher payout. Lastly, if the offer is on multiple networks be sure to <a href=#>split test the traffic</a> and <a href=#>landing pages</a> to see which performs best and make sure there is no network skimming going on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunC0zrBkraddnLK1edOhnGagmZy1pr%2FTZpifnpmhtqLAxGanmrGfqsG0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
