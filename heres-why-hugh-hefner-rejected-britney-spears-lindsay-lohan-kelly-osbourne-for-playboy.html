So, when Playboy announced in October 2015 it would no longer feature entirely nude models, it wasn't surprising they chose Ms. Anderson for the final cover published in December the same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars have turned down</a> heaps of cash and the unrivaled exposure of being a Playboy Playmate - <strong>Jen Aniston, Kate Hudson, Katy Perry</strong>. For them, it wasn't worth the risk to their reputation. After all, they have relatively squeaky-clean images. But for celebs who are willing to literally expose themselves to utter scrutiny, being a centrefold can launch a career. Sometimes, the already famous do it for a much-needed boost to an ego fractured by Hollywood life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Star Turned Down $1 Million From Hugh Hefner To Pose With Pamela Anderson</a></span></p><p>The women listed below are beautiful, yet Hefner denied them entry into his exotic and twisted universe. So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what does Playboy look for in a centrefold</a>? Apart from the obvious physical requirements, the models have to be masters of seduction and completely comfortable in their bodies. Over-augmentation is taboo, and a single negative personality trait is a strike against them. It's understandable, then, why a few celebs on this list were snubbed - it had nothing to do with their looks and everything to do with their lifestyle and personal choices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-osbourne><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kelly Osbourne</span></h2><p>Kelly's as versatile as she is dynamic - actress, singer, model, and fashion designer. After starring with her family on the two-time Emmy-winning reality show <a href=#>The Osbournes</a> (2002 – 2005), Rolling Stone declared she emerged "a wickedly funny, brutally honest, pint-size, potty-mouthed spitfire." Unfortunately, Kelly also developed an interest in drugs. Shock rocker Ozzy's daughter has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seven rehabs</a> under her belt.</p><p>In the midst of that, in 2006, the now pink-haired beauty expressed interest in doing a spread in Playboy. Hugh Hefner responded, "I can't see it happening somehow–we don't airbrush to that extent." Pity because Kelly's got it all together now!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Kelly Osbourne Did To Completely Transform Herself</a></span></p><h2 id=shirley-jones><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Shirley Jones</span></h2><p>In the free-loving 60s, Shirley Jones donned a fluffy tail and floppy ears when she worked at a Playboy Club. The <a href=#>rules were different</a> back then, and it didn’t seem to ruin her stellar reputation. She went on to play the ‘mom next door’ who travelled the country with her musical kids on The Partridge Family in the ‘70s.</p><p>At 75, Shirley posed for 300 test shots, baring only her legs and cleavage in an 1800s French boudoir layout. Before the shoot, Marty Ingels, Shirley’s husband and manager, said, “She's still drop-dead gorgeous…a natural beauty.” Hugh nixed the pics, saying Ms. Jones didn’t reveal enough skin. She said she wouldn’t do it under any circumstances. They wanted more flesh – at 75…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=montana-fishburne><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Montana Fishburne</span></h2><p>Montana Fishburne had thought about entering the entertainment industry since she was 16, but not in the way her Academy Award-nominated dad, Laurence, hoped. Instead, inspired by Kim Kardashian's 2007 sex tape released by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vivid</a>, Montana signed a deal to become an actor in adult films, reportedly earning a whopping $250 K for one movie (stage name "Chippy D"). Naturally, this didn't sit well with Daddy Fishburne and caused <a href=#>a nasty rift in their relationship</a>. Simply put, Laurence was embarrassed.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Montana did nude test shots</a> for Playboy in 2010 at 19. But she didn't meet Hugh's standards, and her spread never went to print, which likely made Mr. Fishburne very happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-gosselin><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kate Gosselin</span></h2><p>This reality television mom of eight dominated the tabloids in 2010, eventually earning the rep of a challenging, demanding Diva. On the cover of their April 2010 issue, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style Magazine featured Kate</a> with the headline, "Out of Control Monster", and a picture that likely made her blow a gasket.</p><p>When she asked Playboy if she could pose nude for the magazine, Hugh replied with insults and a definitive, "No!" Heff also stated he doesn't understand why Gosselin is even on Dancing with the Stars, saying, "I don't think she's a celebrity." Ouch!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audrina-partridge><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Audrina Partridge</span></h2><p>Audrina isn't known for her sharp mind, but she is the queen of the blank stare. So, it's probably a good thing she's beautiful. Before sharing the screen with Heidi, LC, and Whitney on The Hills, Audrina had some nude pics taken to submit to Playboy. Unfortunately, they were "leaked" online without her consent in March 2008.</p><p>Hefner declined her portfolio, stating it didn't capture their interest. Ms. Partridge countered she didn't want them submitted to the magazine at all. Something doesn't mesh. Is she telling the truth? Or, is her claim as empty as her gaze?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bridget-marquardt><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bridget Marquardt</span></h2><p>This lovely lady attempted to get the coveted centrefold of Playboy several times, but never did. The reasons are unknown, but Bridget never gave up, and her story has a somewhat happy ending. Instead, Hefner moved her into his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive mansion</a> to appear on the reality show <a href=#>Girls Next Door</a> as one of his girlfriends, along with Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson. Although this meant Bridget had to stay in the mansion longer than any girl probably should, it led to her own reality show, so she boosted her brand name without removing all her clothes.</p><p>Eventually, Bridget got her wish, and she posed with Holly and Kendra in 3 cover pictorials.</p><h2 id=debbie-harry><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Debbie Harry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like Shirley Jones, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Debbie Harry</a> worked as a Bunny Hostess in a London Playboy club in her youth. When she tried out for the magazine, Hefner refused because he thought she was too skinny. Not deterred from the entertainment industry, Debbie made music instead. In 1974, with guitarist Chris Stein, she formed Blondie, a new wave act that played many of the legendary clubs in New York City.</p><p>Debbie has sold 40 million albums and is still going strong. Today, Ms. Harry is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth an estimated $30 Million</a> and has the last laugh.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus Shares Throwback Photo With Rock Queens Joan Jett And Debbie Harry</a></span></p><h2 id=michaele-salahi><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Michaele Salahi</span></h2><p>The self-described former model and White House state dinner crasher had many erotic photos done, but didn’t make it into the magazine. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Housewives of DC star</a> was reportedly told by email that Playboy didn’t have an upcoming cover or spread suitable for her. Instead, the publication offered to put her on their website, which never happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many reality TV celebs, Michaele wasn’t happy with only 15 minutes of fame, so in September 2011, she ran off with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Neal Schon</a>, guitarist for the rock band Journey. They are still married and living in San Francisco.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lindsay Lohan</span></h2><p>It’s hard to fathom the cute little girl from The Parent Trap baring it all for a men’s magazine, but a lot has happened to Lindsay since then. Her battle with addiction and stints in rehab have been <a href=#>front-page tabloid fodder</a> for years. But, Heff paid Lindsay $1 Million to pose for Playboy in 2011, proving her star power. Unfortunately, the editors weren’t happy, and she had to go back for a second shoot. In addition, Ms. Lohan has a reputation of being unreliable (likely due to her addiction) and missed a flight to do a promo on a TV show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, Lindsay worked hard at getting it together and in April 2020, she dropped her first single in more than a decade. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Back to Me”</a> is about facing her past and coming to terms with it.</p><h2 id=britney-spears><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Britney Spears</span></h2><p>Like Lindsay Lohan, Britney entered show business as a child on The Mickey Mouse Club. At the beginning of her music career, she displayed a wholesome image that quickly became more provocative. She could have been on the cover of any magazine at the height of her fame. But after countless incidents like her botched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">performance at the MTV Video Awards</a>, and the many revealing pics the paparazzi took, her stock went down. Playboy initially offered $400 K to do the dirty deed, but <a href=#>she demanded $1 Million</a>, which other celebrities of her calibre earned. Hugh reportedly said until she got her life together, she wouldn’t be in his magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney’s back in the news again, this time over her conservatorship. She’s fighting to get her life turned around, and it’s a shame Mr. Hefner isn’t here to witness it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Times Britney Spears Nailed The Answers To Inappropriate Interview Questions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmn66fmGK1prLNnqlmqpWfsqTAxJ1km6qZqbumxYysp56Zoqh6rbXNnaqasV2hvKmtzWainqScrnqwv8GorKumlWKzsL6MqaOasZKkxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
