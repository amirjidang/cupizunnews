We have a complicated relationship with energy drinks. We’ve tried the big names like Red Bull and Monster plenty of times, but the jittery jolts of energy followed by the devastating sugar crashes are…not quite our favorite, to say the least."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’ve tried the big names like Red Bull and Monster plenty of times, but the jittery jolts of energy followed by the devastating sugar crashes are…not quite our favorite, to say the least. But we still need something to help get us through a drowsy day or a tough workout. We can only drink so much coffee or tea in a day — and we like to keep those to morning hours only — so what are our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other options</a>?</p><p>Thankfully, a new option just dropped, and it’s looking like a million bucks to Us. We need to introduce you to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZOA</a>, a brand new energy drink from <strong>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</strong> himself — king of fitness and charismatic energy, even during super early call times or morning gym sessions. For two weeks, ZOA is available on GNC’s website and directly from the brand, and now is the time to take advantage of that early access!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dwayne-Johnson.jpg><p><strong>Be among the first to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">try ZOA</a> at GNC.com!</strong></p><p>Johnson described ZOA as being all about “healthy, positive energy that helps us all focus, be productive and get stronger together.” He described it on Instagram as a one-of-a-kind “healthy energy formula.” Unlike those other big name energy brands, this Warrior Blend is made with clean ingredients to benefit your immunity, hydration, body and energy. You’ll find zero sugar, zero artificial flavors, zero synthetic colors and zero preservatives on the ingredient list!</p><p>Let’s talk about all of the good things <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZOA</a> does have on that ingredient list. First, it’s packed with vitamins: C, D, B6, B12, B1 and B2. You’ll also find potassium and magnesium electrolytes to keep you feeling hydrated and healthy, plus amino acids, which may help with muscle growth, reduced exercise fatigue and more. And for that sustained energy boost? 160mg of natural caffeine from green tea extract and green coffee!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ZOA-in-post-2.jpg><p><strong>Be among the first to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">try ZOA</a> at GNC.com!</strong></p><p>We know one thing you’re worried about is flavors. Some energy drinks…simply do not taste very good, to be polite about it. With ZOA, you won’t have to hold your nose to get through a can. There are five awesome flavors you can try: Super Berry, Wild Orange, Pineapple Coconut, Lemon Lime and Original!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ZOA</a> is recommended for pretty much whenever you need it, apart from maybe close to bedtime. Getting ready for a tough Zoom workout or long run? Make ZOA your pre-sweat ritual. Hitting that midday slump during a long workday or after a night spent tossing and turning? Let ZOA be your pick-me-up. Order today from GNC.com and be one of the first, ever, to smell what The Rock cooked up this time!</p><p><strong>Be among the first to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">try ZOA</a> at GNC.com!</strong></p><p><strong>Looking for more?
