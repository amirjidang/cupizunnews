“I would go to the party and leave early,” the 63-year-old rapper told the We In Miami podcast. “I’m sorry.

I don’t know what goes on after hours but I wasn’t trying to find out. I know my place.” His expression conveyed the idea that things were going on that he did not want to be part of, though he did not explicitly share any details.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He also told the story of not approving <a href=#>French Montana </a>sampling his hit “I Wanna Rock” on “Pop That” with Rick Ross, Drake, and Lil Wayne. Diddy reached out to get him in the video and he declined, clarifying that there wasn’t any issue but the situation just wasn’t his “vibe.” The hosts asked if he was offered money for the sample and he replied, “I ain’t want no check.” Watch below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Uncle Luke isn’t the only person to speak about Diddy’s parties. Recently 50 Cent, who has been critical of Puff consistently, explained why he doesn’t attend the functions. “Nuh uh,” he told the crowd at one of his shows. “That ni**a hug you from the front and the back at the same time? F**k you talkin’ ’bout? I mean, if you into that, you into that. I’m fine with it. I’m just saying this ain’t my motherf**kin’ kind of party. I’m uncomfortable. I think I belong in the girl’s bathroom.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Bad Boy founder’s hot seat is at all-time high temperatures. <a href=#>Homeland Security raided</a> his Los Angeles and Miami homes on Monday (March 26) as part of a <a href=#>sex trafficking </a>investigation. His sons Christian Combs and Justin Combs were found in the Los Angeles residence. As for Puff, he was spotted in Miami and his private jet was tracked to Antigua.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Diddy was first accused of sexual misconduct in November following a lawsuit by his <a href=#>ex-girlfriend Cassie</a>. Though they <a href=#>settled outside of court</a>, this opened the floodgates for other women to come forward with more accusations. Both the “I Need A Girl” artist and former Bad Boy President <a href=#>Harve Pierre</a> were accused of <a href=#>gang-raping </a>a woman in 2003 when she was 17 years old.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lil’ Rod, a producer who worked with Diddy on The Love Album: Off The Grid, filed a lawsuit against the mogul in February. He also accused him of sexual assault, claiming that he would walk around his home naked while they lived and worked together for over a year. One of the most disturbing allegations was his claim that he was forced to work in the bathroom while the producer showered.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cassie and Rod’s<a href=#> attorneys</a> shared their comments on the recent raid, expressing their approval of him being held accountable for his “depraved conduct” and the hope that justice is served given all the people he has allegedly hurt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6q7pLjEZqOuo5Visaqww7JkqZmiqbamv4ylnJqulWKyor7LsmRqamNphXeAkm9qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
