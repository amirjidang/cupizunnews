While it is usually more enjoyable to take a look at those that have managed to hone their craft into something brilliant, it can also be a bit of fun to take a look at the actors that are just plain bad!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We have pulled together some of the worst television actors out there, the ones that we still struggle to watch. We cannot understand how this lot managed to find any roles on the TV, or the worldwide fame that has followed many of them now that they've found lucrative television work.</p><p>It's about time that we took a look at these actors, went through some of the people on television that we don't think can act. Get these people off our television screens as soon as possible or we may have to turn it off forever!</p><h2 id=johnny-galecki><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>&nbsp;Johnny Galecki</span></h2><p>In a way, we feel pretty bad for this guy. He was thrown into a huge amount of fame at a very young age.</p><p>However, we very quickly stop feeling bad for him when we realize how much money he is walking around with just for putting in some mediocre performances in two boring TV shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julie-bowen><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Julie Bowen</span></h2><p>The other main female in Modern Family may play a completely different character to Sofia Vergara, but the two of them are very similar in that they both rely on shouting and overacting to get their point across.</p><p>It's not exactly a show that is known for its subtlety we suppose...</p><h2 id=claire-danes><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Claire Danes</span></h2><p>We had to think about putting this woman on the list as she does a lot of important work outside the world of television, but she gets paid to act and she really cannot act.</p><p>It's great that she considers herself a social activist, but making her the main role in Homeland was a bad idea...</p><h2 id=andrew-lincoln><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Andrew Lincoln</span></h2><p>We didn't think it was possible for an actor to be overshadowed by entire mobs of zombies, but somehow they manage to show a little more life than Lincoln does in TWD.</p><p>We were glad to see him leave, but there's talk he'll be back in some movies based on the series...</p><h2 id=kit-harington><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Kit Harington</span></h2><p>He may not have been the absolute worst actor in Game Of Thrones, we think he is easily second on that list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did his accent keep slipping throughout the show, but he failed to show any emotion at some of the most emotional moments in the show's narrative.</p><h2 id=krysten-ritter><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Krysten Ritter</span></h2><p>When we first saw her in Breaking Bad, we assumed that her ability was just being overshadowed by the likes of Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston, but as she started to get her own shows we could see that there was no ability at all. Jessica Jones would be watchable if it wasn't for her.</p><h2 id=kiefer-sutherland><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Kiefer Sutherland</span></h2><p>Everyone can agree that there were too many seasons of 24, but we're always surprised to hear how many people actually liked Sutherland as Bauer.</p><p>He brought very little to the show that couldn't be brought by any other actor out there, his overacting often ruining the major tension moments in the show.</p><h2 id=john-krasinski><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>John Krasinski</span></h2><p>A lot of people talk about how great this guy is in The Office, but we think that he's the most boring actor in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are so many different personalities trying to push their way into the limelight, while this guy just ends up looking at the camera from time to time, which anyone could do!</p><h2 id=courteney-cox><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Courteney Cox</span></h2><p>Sure, she may have been a part of Friends, one of the most popular situation comedies&nbsp;of all time, but Cox was easily the worst actor in that show.</p><p>Throw in the fact that she has continued to put in terrible work ever since then in shows like C Town&nbsp;and we hope that she quits acting soon...</p><h2 id=taylor-schilling><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Taylor Schilling</span></h2><p>The more and more Orange Is The New Black goes on, the less they have this actor at the forefront, and we can only imagine it's because the writers realized how little talent she had pretty quickly.</p><p>We can only hope that they end up just slowly writing her out of the show while nobody is looking...</p><h2 id=maisie-williams><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Maisie Williams</span></h2><p>She's only young, so we know there's a chance this will change, but she was easily one of the worst actors in Game Of Thrones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We may all love her as a person and as an internet persona, but there's just no getting past that she's one of the most wooden actors in modern television history.</p><h2 id=cole-sprouse><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Cole Sprouse</span></h2><p>He and his brother started out young, and while the two of them definitely make us laugh online, we don't think that either of them has shown they actually have the ability to act yet.</p><p>Riverdale is genuinely difficult to watch whenever Sprouse frowns his way onto our screens.</p><h2 id=timothy-olyphant><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Timothy Olyphant</span></h2><p>It's no surprise to us that this actor has had to jump between television and the big screen as he constantly looks uncomfortable no matter what role he has decided to take on.</p><p>In our opinion,&nbsp;Santa Clarita Diet would've been a lot better if this guy hadn't been cast as the male lead.</p><h2 id=christina-applegate><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Christina Applegate</span></h2><p>Applegate cut her teeth on the show Married... With Children, in which she played a vapid character with little to say.</p><p>We felt that this didn't give her much of a chance to show what she had to offer, but she has continued to act in exactly the same way, offering us very little to enjoy at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-hendricks><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christina Hendricks</span></h2><p>It's just a fact of life that showbiz is filled with women that managed to find their way in because of how they looked, and we think it's fair to say that about Christina Hendricks.</p><p>Despite her looks, she was the actor we were least interested in having on the screen when watching Mad Men.</p><h2 id=vince-vaughn><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Vince Vaughn</span></h2><p>We can never understand how this actor finds work.</p><p>Not only has he appeared in numerous bad movies in the past, the sort that only makes people under a certain age laugh, but he was able to tank True Detective, a series that people absolutely adored until he entered it.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>If it were up to us, Lady Gaga would stick to singing for the rest of her life. Every single time she has set foot on the screen we have ended up cringing, but this was most true when she found herself in AHS.</p><p>She may act creepy, but she clearly isn't creepy at all.</p><h2 id=chris-pratt><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Chris Pratt</span></h2><p>How this man has become the Hollywood star of the moment is beyond us!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was easily the most boring actor to watch on Parks And Recreation, so we can't understand how anyone saw that and felt that he would be a perfect match for a big budget action movie!</p><h2 id=sofia-vergara><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sofia Vergara</span></h2><p>After finding work on Modern Family, this woman found a lot of money and even more fame. We don't understand why though, as her over the top acting continues to annoy us whenever we see her.</p><p>There is nothing subtle about what this actress puts out there so we're just not interested.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kaley Cuoco</span></h2><p>She started out on television pretty young so she could be excused for some bad work in the past, but she's older now and she should definitely know better.</p><p>Is it just us, or does this woman end up playing exactly the same characters no matter what role she puts her mind to?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirr2WRmMGwvtJmrqGnXaiys7XOrqqlsV2Yrq%2FAjJqarWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
