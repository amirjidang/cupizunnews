The show brought together some of the hottest young men and women, put them in a private villa in Mexico, and laid down some rather difficult rules. Think of a kid in a candy store being told he can only look but not touch or eat any candy. Tough right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Too Hot To Handle' Exclusive: Larissa Trownson Reveals What Netflix Didn't Air</a></span></p><p>So while these people were encouraged to mingle and build meaningful relationships, they were strictly forbidden from touching each other or engaging in any sexual activity to win the prize money at the end of the show. Some were successful and as expected, some simply couldn't resist the temptation. And while some of the contestants went on to have romantic relationships, some others have actually been able to stay friends. Who are they? Find out!</p><h2 id=chloe-veitch-and-nicole-o-rsquo-brien><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chloe Veitch And Nicole O’Brien</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chloe Veitch and Nicole O’Brien developed a close friendship from their time on the show and it’s adorable to see that their friendship has grown so much more in real life. In the days since the show’s season finale, the two have been spotted hanging out in London. And while this makes our hearts swoon, what is even cuter is the occasional coordinated outfits.</p><p>Speaking to ET, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole gave insight into her and Chloe’s friendship</a>, admitting that they “have been literally joined to the hip” since the show ended. She shared plans of them moving in together and starting a podcast or YouTube channel together. According to her, they have a lot of plans in the works and if Nicole’s words are anything to go by, we are in for some amazing projects inspired by love and friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is ‘Too Hot To Handle’ Host Desiree Burch, And How Much Is She Worth In 2021?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-birtwistle-and-sharron-townsend><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>David Birtwistle And Sharron Townsend</span></h2><p>The ultimate win for David from the Too Hot To Handle is his budding bromance with fellow cast member, Sharron. While David didn’t find love with any of the female cast until the arrival of late addition, Lydia Clyma, he was briefly in a love triangle with Rhonda and Sharron.</p><p>He ended up taking himself out of the triangle and leaving Sharron to pursue Rhonda. What we did not see coming was a friendship between the two men in question. The pair formed a bond and have continued to maintain it even now, long after the show has ended.</p><h2 id=harry-jowsey-and-francesca-farago><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Harry Jowsey And Francesca Farago</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably the hottest and most controversial couple to emerge from Too Hot To Handle, <a href=#>Harry Jowsey and Francesca Farago</a> were some of the most memorable characters from the show’s first season.</p><p>They started out strong, fell in love and came out of the island as a couple. They later broke up and were apart for a total of eight months. But as with most Hollywood couples, Harry and Franseca soon got back together and even got engaged. Still, their love was seemingly not meant to be as they broke up yet again. Regardless, Harry and Franseca have remained friends and are still following each other on social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Surprising Facts About These 'Too Hot To Handle' Season 2 Cast Members</a></span></p><h2 id=cam-holmes-and-emily-miller><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Cam Holmes And Emily Miller</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The second season of Too Hot To Handle saw different cast members but that did not make the season any less dramatic. Season two hotties Cam Holmes and Emily Miller for sure brought the heat to our TV screens. Cam, a self proclaimed ‘sexy nerd’ and Emily, a London based model, formed a bond early on in the show and had their own share of troubles.</p><p>The show, however, ended with Cam and Emily making their relationship official. Today, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their love is seemingly waxing stronger</a>. Now, it is not uncommon to find the couple sharing pictures and gushing about each other on social media. If these pictures are anything to go by, Cam and Emily are definitely happy together.</p><h2 id=marvin-anthony-and-melinda-melrose><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Marvin Anthony And Melinda Melrose</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Marvin Anthony and Melina Melrose were very much the alpha couple at the end of the season 2 and even though there were a few bumps along their relationship road, it actually really seemed like they would end up together.</p><p>Sadly, fans were disappointed to hear that the two broke up shortly after the show ended. But this was apparently not enough to make them lose sight of their friendship as Melinda and Marvin have remained cordial since the split. Melinda said on the show Extra Hot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"For a long time we didn't talk or anything... But now we're talking and on good terms.</a>" Friends for life, maybe? Guess time will tell.</p><h2 id=christina-carmela-and-robert-van-tromp><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Christina Carmela And Robert Van Tromp</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two late arrivals did not let their later than usual timestamp hold them back from finding love on show. It seemed like the two fell into each other’s arms seeing that other members were already paired up when they got on the show.</p><p>For as long as it lasted, Christine and Robert’s romance was a big deal. That is, until they broke up, citing long distance and frequent arguments as the reason. Despite not being together, they still have mutual respect for each other and are both still following one another on social media.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is ‘Too Hot To Handle’ Star, Peter Vigilante?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKddnby1edOoZKGZnpm5pnnCmqqtZZ2auqOx0axkrKyZoblustGinKeco2K1or7RsmSjp6eosrp5xauYp5uVqLCiecWaqZqfn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
