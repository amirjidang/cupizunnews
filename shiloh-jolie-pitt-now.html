Does not it just seem like yesterday that Brangelina debuted their beloved newborn on the cover of People Magazine?</p><p>It seems Shiloh Jolie-Pitt has undergone quite the makeover while in lockdown if these new photos are anything to go by. Sporting denim cut-offs, pierced ears, and long locks tied up in a bun, it’s a far cry from the gender-bending tomboy dressing Shiloh has worn over the years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-3-1024x768.png><p>The 15-year-old made a rare public appearance when she was snapped visiting an Ethiopian design boutique in Los Angeles alongside mum Angelina Jolie and 16-year-old sister Zaharaon on January 8.</p><p>Wearing a black hoodie and denim cut-off shorts along with black Converse trainers, Shiloh has also shot up in the height department. Her unusual look could even be considered conventional or stereotypical, at least compared to her old style.</p><p>Angelina said Vanity Fair in a 2010 interview that Shiloh has been exploring gender since age three. “She wants to be a boy,” Jolie said. “So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boy clothes. She thinks she’s one of her brothers.” In a 2008 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Brad opened up about raising Shiloh: “She only wants to be called John. John or Peter. It’s a Peter Pan thing. And then I’ll say, ‘John, would you like some orange juice?’ And she goes, ‘No!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-5.png><p>Since then, countless fans have widely referred to Shiloh as John, with a whole Wikipedia page and social fan pages popping up all over the internet. In fact, a hunt on Google Trends reveals that online users are exploring both “Shiloh” and “John” pretty equally.</p><p>No matter what name Shiloh likes to go by or what clothes to wear, Angelina and Brad have done nothing but welcome their kiddo’s uniqueness. “I would never be the kind of parent to force somebody to be something they are not,” the Maleficent star told Reuters. “I think that is just bad parenting.”</p><p>Angelina and Brad raised Shiloh together until they got divorced in 2016. Since then, they have been confused in a tumultuous custody battle, with the latest update in May 2021 when the Fight Club actor was granted joint custody.</p><p>Though it’s been a long road and their children have “been through a lot,” the Those Who Wish Me Dead actress said her kids’ courage her. “I learn from their strength,” Angelina told Harper’s Bazaar in 2019. “We can’t prevent them from experiencing pain, heartache, physical pain, and loss. But we can teach them to live better through it.”</p><p>Over the years, Shiloh has also created a buzz with her androgynous, bold chic style. Her parents always supported her in dressing the way she wanted. She would wear casual separates as a child – polo shirts, jackets, blazers, shorts, dark trousers, jeans, and oversized tracksuits.</p><p>When Shiloh’s parents would take her to red carpet premieres and events, she skipped gowns and dresses in favor of suits similar to what her dad wore.</p><p>So it’s no shock that followers of the superstar family have seen the unexpected change in Shiloh’s style. In any case, Shiloh’s had a massive growth spurt and seems to be already heightening over her mother.</p><p>There are few facts about Shiloh that will amaze you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-6-1024x1024.png><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Facts About Shiloh Jolie-Pitt</h2><p>In 2006, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt first commanded international headlines as the firstborn of America’s most star-studded couple.
