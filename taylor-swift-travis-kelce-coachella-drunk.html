While it remains to be seen if Swift will write any songs about Kelce like she might have <a href=#>written tunes about exes like Tom Hiddleston</a>, the beloved couple definitely like to have public date nights. Considering <a href=#>the football player's high net worth</a> and, of course, <a href=#>Forbes naming Swift a billionaire</a>, it's no wonder Kelce and Swift can attend any event they please.</p><p>There was one moment at Coachella 2024 that got people talking, and it naturally included Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

If a lot of fans felt that she was behaving in a particularly wild or memorable way, it seems likely that they would talk about it since they're very invested in her life. Since many fans thought that the couple looked happy and great together, this suggests that they thought that Kelce and Swift had a perfectly normal time. Life & Style quoted one fan who wrote, “I just melted! This is adorable!”</p><p>As several publications reported, fans loved that <strong>Kelce planted a kiss on Swift's face </strong>while they were watching a performance at Coachella.

She noted:</p><p>“Disclaimer: Lip reading is not a reliable form of communication, all statements are alleged."</p><p>According to My San Antonio, Jackie Gonzalez shares her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lip reading analysis of stars</a> regularly.
