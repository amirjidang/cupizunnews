Nina Dobrev, who played the lead on the show (Elena Gilbert), looked really familiar.</p><p>But watching the show's credits, it became clear that Nina Dobrev was the headlining act.</p><p>The thing was, she looked so much like another Hollywood actress, even Wikipedia once got confused. Yep, there's a broken link to an article about CW casting Victoria Justice. Only, that never happened.</p><p>Honestly, it's a relief that someone finally said it: Victoria Justice and Nina Dobrev look a lot alike.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_nina-dobrev-refused-to-discuss-shaun-white-in-an-interview-fans-labeled-pretentious_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nina Dobrev Refused To Discuss Shaun White In An Interview Fans Labeled Pretentious</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>An interview with Nina Dobrev's was lackluster, according to fans, who labeled her pretentious for her responses.</span><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong>Nina Dobrev and Shaun White are still going strong after four years together. While Dobrev continues to star in projects, most recently being "The Bricklayer", White is staying busy with his brand, Whitespace, as well as snowboarding, despite retiring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Victoria Justice is a part of the group of child actors who worked at Nickelodeon during the timeframe that the "Quiet on the Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV" docuseries takes place. There are clips of Justice in the docuseries but she is not one of the actors who has made accusations against anyone at Nickelodeon during her time at the network.</p><h2 id=victoria-justice-admits-to-getting-mistaken-for-nina-dobrev>Victoria Justice Admits To Getting Mistaken For Nina Dobrev</h2><h3 id=victoria-justice-thinks-getting-mistaken-for-nina-dobrev-is-a-huge-compliment>Victoria Justice thinks getting mistaken for Nina Dobrev is a huge compliment</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/victoria-justice.jpg><p>Fans aren't the only ones who've noticed the similarity between Victoria and Nina. Victoria told MTV that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">people often mistake her for Nina in everyday life</a>, explaining, "Dude! You don't understand, I get this every single day... Everyone always confuses me for her." So it wasn't surprising when MTV journalists asked for her thoughts on one red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Victoria notes, it's a complete compliment. And upon meeting, the pair 'hugged it out.' The ladies are also close in age; Victoria is 31 and Nina is 35. So, they could be sisters.</p><h2 id=nina-dobrev-and-victoria-justice-are-not-related>Nina Dobrev And Victoria Justice Are NOT Related</h2><h3 id=victoria-justice-and-nina-dobrev-have-very-different-backgrounds-and-grew-up-in-different-locales>Victoria Justice and Nina Dobrev have very different backgrounds and grew up in different locales</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar53559580-1.jpg><p>Except, it's highly unlikely that they're actually related, even distantly. Victoria Justice's background is a mix of English, German, Irish, and Puerto Rican ancestry, and she grew up in Florida before moving to California. Nina Dobrev, however, was born in Bulgaria and moved to Toronto, Canada at age two.</p><p>In fact, Nina's start as an actress came from a role on Degrassi: The Next Generation. That's basically the equivalent of Victoria Justice's Hollywood beginnings on Zoe: 101, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ladies both appeared at the Teen Choice Awards in 2015, where Victoria presented Nina with her award for Choice TV Actress, Sci-Fi/Fantasy.</p><p>Fans were delighted again when the pair of doppelg√§ngers crossed paths non-profesionally at, of all places, a polo match, noted Huffington Post. They even posed for pics together!</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/why-did-nina-dobrev-and-ian-somerhalder-break-up-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Why Did Nina Dobrev And Ian Somerhalder Break Up?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The break-up might've been caused by the age difference between the actors, according to sources. Are Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder still friends?</span><p>The comparisons between the actresses extend beyond their looks, though. Nina Dobrev wound up leaving The Vampire Diaries for reasons similar to Victoria Justice's exit from Nickelodeon.</p><p>The bottom line? Neither actress wanted to play a high schooler forever.</p><h2 id=victoria-justice-and-nina-dobren-have-more-in-common-still>Victoria Justice And Nina Dobren Have More In Common Still</h2><h3 id=nina-dobrev-and-victoria-justice-are-philanthropists-and-have-a-similar-net-worth>Nina Dobrev and Victoria Justice are philanthropists and have a similar net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar53544134-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even more impressive on the list of the ladies' similarities? They're both very active in philanthropy. At the same time, neither actress is at all flashy about her millions. There again is something the ladies have in common: <strong>Nina Dobrev has a net worth of $11 million</strong> and Victoria Justice is in the same ballpark with a <strong>net worth of $12 million</strong>.</p><p>But the two don't have everything in common. Nina dated her co-star, Ian Somerhalder, while Victoria's relationship with the leading lad on Victorious (Avan Jogia) never moved beyond friendship (supposedly).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/was-there-a-pay-gap-on-the-vampire-diaries_-here-s-how-much-paul-wesley-nina-dobrev-and-ian-somerhalder-were-paid.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Would Nina Dobrev Return To The Franchise After Quitting 'Vampire Diaries' Early?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nina Dobrev left The Vampire Diaries early, but she might be willing to return to the franchise.</span><p>Of course, each lady has her own career highlights and a unique path to celebrity.
