While they may loathe it, the identical twins have been exposed to the intense and unruly attention of the press and diehard fans ever since their Disney Channel days. As they've glown up, the spotlight has become even hotter. That means every single woman in their life has felt the effects. Fortunately, many of Dylan and Cole's girlfriends are used to fame themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former Disney Channel twins have gone through <a href=#>their fair share of breakups with famous women</a>. Many of them have built an incredible net worth to match<a href=#> their combined net worth of $16 million</a>. Here's how much Cole and Dylan's current and former girlfriends are worth in 2022...</p><h2 id=cole-sprouse-39-s-ex-girlfriend-bree-morgan-39-s-worth-is-unknown><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Cole Sprouse's Ex-Girlfriend Bree Morgan's Worth Is Unknown</span></h2><p>Bree Morgan's net worth is simply unknown. While many sites claim they know what she's worth, they simply don't have a clue. This is because Bree is by far the most "normal" woman that either twin has ever dated. That's not to say she's not successful. In fact, her Instagram and Youtube channels have built quite the following due to her gamer lifestyle. Cole and Bree dated for about three years while attending New York University together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dylan-sprouse-39-s-ex-girlfriend-dayna-frazer-is-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Dylan Sprouse's Ex-Girlfriend Dayna Frazer Is Worth $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Dayna Frazer was not happy with Dylan Sprouse after their breakup in 2017, in fact, she straight-up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused him of not being faithful</a> to her. Regardless of what really did or did not transpire <a href=#>between Dylan and Dayna</a>, there's no doubt that they once appeared to be deeply in love. While Dayna is a painter and a blogger, she's made most of her money as a model. While Idol Net Worth claims Dayna's modeling career has earned her a $3 million net worth, most sites claim that her wealth is somewhere closer to $1.5 million. Either way, there's no doubt that Dayna continues to make a name for herself in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cole-sprouse-39-s-ex-girlfriend-alyson-stoner-is-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cole Sprouse's Ex-Girlfriend Alyson Stoner Is Worth $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Cole reportedly dumped Alyson Stoner, who is best known for her work on The Disney Channel, on her 12th birthday. This was particularly tough for her as she once said, "The first boy, I guess, that I had like a crush on and dated was Cole Sprouse." According to Celebrity Net Worth, Alyson's $1.5 million fortune is due to Cheaper By The Dozen, Camp Rock, and The Suite Life With Zack And Cody with her future ex-boyfriend.</p><h2 id=cole-sprouse-39-s-ex-girlfriend-lili-reinhart-is-worth-6-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cole Sprouse's Ex-Girlfriend Lili Reinhart Is Worth $6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, Cole and Lili remain "good friends" after their extremely high-profile relationship came to an end. Even though they continue to make Riverdale together, the two are almost never spotted together at social events or even on set. So, while they may be friendly, we're not so sure that they're close. But that makes sense because their on-and-off-again romance (2017 - 2020) was a challenge. Lili, in particular, has voiced her frustration with how the press and fans treated her when news broke that she was dating on co-star.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's The Scoop On Lili Reinhart's Workout Routine... She Looks Stunning In These Insta Posts</a></span></p><p>Despite all of that, Lili's career continues to skyrocket. Her $6 million net worth is attributed to her starring role on CW's Riverdale but also her work in several other projects including Hustlers, Charlie's Angels, Chemical Hearts, Galveston, and Miss Stevens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cole-sprouse-39-s-ex-girlfriend-victoria-justice-is-worth-12-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cole Sprouse's Ex-Girlfriend Victoria Justice Is Worth $12 Million</span></h2><p>Like Alyson Stoner, Victoria Justice dated Cole for a brief time after her appearance on The Suite Life With Zack and Cody. While they were just 11 at the time, the pair were a cute couple. The future Nickelodeon star even claimed that Cole was her very first kiss. Her incredible $12 million net worth is no doubt due to her work on the Nickelodeon show Zoey 101 and her very own series, Victorious. Then there's her music career, modeling, and the copious other film and TV projects she's been involved with.</p><h2 id=dylan-sprouse-39-s-ex-girlfriend-miley-cyrus-is-worth-160-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dylan Sprouse's Ex-Girlfriend Miley Cyrus Is Worth $160 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The wealthiest person on this list is undoubtedly <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>. She's only one of the biggest musical talents in the world. Not to mention her Hannah Montana success. Given the sheer amount of her hits, tours, and product endorsements, $160 million may be an underestimate on Celebrity Net Worth's part. Either way, Miley is loaded. Miley and Dylan met on set in their Disney Channel days when he was just 11 or 12. He claims they briefly dated until she started becoming interested in Nick Jonas.</p><h2 id=dylan-sprouse-39-s-current-girlfriend-barbara-palvin-is-worth-6-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dylan Sprouse's Current Girlfriend Barbara Palvin Is Worth $6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barbara Palvin is easily one of the most famous models in the world. Her growing net worth has benefited from her collaborations with Sports Illustrated, Elle, Allure, Harper's Bazaar, Prada, and becoming a full-fledged Victoria's Secret Angel. While she hasn't earned the supermodel status, the Hungarian talent has an enormous social media following. Of course, this is partly due to her high-profile romances with several stars, including her current, longtime partner, Dylan Sprouse.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Barbara Palvin Actually Thinks About Victoria's Secret</a></span></p><p>The two have been together since 2018. Although they could've gotten together earlier as he was interested in her for some time and she failed to respond to his DMs. Regardless, the highly private pair actually live together and appear inseparable whenever they're spotted out in public.</p><h2 id=cole-sprouse-39-s-current-girlfriend-ari-fournier-is-worth-500-000><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cole Sprouse's Current Girlfriend Ari Fournier Is Worth $500,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Up and coming model Ari Fournier was first spotted with Cole in Vancouver, B.C. while he was shooting Riverdale in 2021. Cole was spotted with a couple of gorgeous women in the Canadian coastal metropolis shortly after his high-profile breakup with his co-star, Lili Reinhart. So, there were a lot of rumors swirling around who he might be dating. A few months later, however, Cole confirmed his relationship with the stunning blonde. He posted photos of her that he took with a caption, "Time to p*** off the 14-year-olds again", referring to his obsessive fans who don't tend to be kind to the women in his life. Cole and Ari have been going strong ever since and were recently spotted on the red carpet together alongside Dylan and Barbara.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ari's net worth is attributed to her work as a model with Elite Management. According to Elle, she was discovered at the age of 14 and has been working ever since. There's no doubt that her high-profile relationship with Cole Sprouse will aid her already successful career.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Cole Sprouse’s New Girlfriend Made Her Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6pLvLnmSappRisbq4wKdkrKiipMK0sdJmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnapmmZ6ZerW0xKKpZqWRqMCqwsRmpZ6sXay8s8DHrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
