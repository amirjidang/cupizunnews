Neither Moore nor Costner have addressed the rumors about their friendship, with both focusing on personal challenges in their lives.      Demi Moore is gearing up for a new high-profile project, but while it may be a huge career (and net worth) boost for the actress, it’s also apparently cost her friendship with Kevin Costner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But both actors have enough to focus on in their personal lives. Demi’s family is currently dealing with Bruce Willis’ dementia diagnosis.</p><p>Bruce and Demi were married from 1987 to 2000. During their marriage, they welcomed three daughters: Rumer, born in 1988, Scout, born in 1991, and Tallulah, born in 1994. Bruce Willis is currently married to Emma Heming, whom he wed in 2009, and they share two daughters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several years ago, the family released a joint statement announcing that <a href=#>Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia</a>, a condition linked to a form of dementia. This diagnosis has led to significant shifts in his career and personal life, as he announced his retirement from acting, though reports say his entire family (including his ex-wife and current wife) have banded together to support him during the health crisis.</p><p>Costner has also gone through a lot in his personal life, as he just settled his divorce from Christine Baumgartner, nearly a year after she filed following almost 20 years of marriage.</p><p>A court decided <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin will pay Christine a little over $60,000</a> in monthly child support for their three kids, a figure that’s much less than Christine was expecting. She attempted unsuccessfully to secure a higher divorce settlement and child support deal despite having a prenup in place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnqWZYrqwu9Geqmamlax6sb7Oo5ycrF2gsre1zWaaqKuko7KzecKuq2asmZrAbsXEmqmsZZantqa6w6yfoqhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
