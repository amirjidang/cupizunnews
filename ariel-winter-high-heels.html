The 19-year-old Modern Family star rocked a pair of sky-high stilettos when she stepped out in Los Angeles yesterday.

Her pink bag, which lists for $3,980 online, certainly stood out against her all-black ensemble, but with a net worth of more than $10m, the luxury purse was not weighing her down."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 19-year-old Modern Family star rocked a pair of sky-high stilettos when she stepped out in Los Angeles yesterday. Decked out in a black cocktail dress and a pink Gucci bag, the 5ft 1 in actress is quickly shedding her onscreen teen persona to become a thoroughly modern woman.</p><p>Her pink bag, which lists for $3,980 online, certainly stood out against her all-black ensemble, but with a net worth of more than $10m, the luxury purse was not weighing her down. The outfit was a dramatic change from the Goth get up she was wearing earlier in the day while <a href=#>hanging out with her beau</a>.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>ARIEL WINTER ROCKS ALL LEATHER OUTFIT IN LOS ANGELES IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEATWAVE</a></strong></p><p>Winter, who has had a few tumultuous years, is now happily dating actor Levi Meaden, 30, known for his roles in Aftermath, The Killing, and The 100. Back in 2015, <a href=#>Winter</a> became officially emancipated from her mother, who she claimed was physically and emotionally abusive. That same year, she underwent breast reduction surgery in order to ease her back pain and correct her posture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It started to hurt so bad that I couldn't take the pain," she said at the time. "My neck was hurting so bad, and I actually had some problems with my spine. I had been discussing my chest with doctors for many years, but when I finally said, 'I'm thinking of doing this,' he said, 'Your back is going to thank you so much.'"</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>ARIEL WINTER MAKES US WISH CHRISTMAS CAME SOONER</a></strong></p><p>On Christmas Eve, Winter, who lives with Maeden, posted an Instagram pic of the couple dressed up&nbsp;for a night out. The next morning, she shared a pic of the two wearing matching pajamas and sharing a kiss in front of their Christmas tree. In a cheeky nod to her own family past, she shared another pic of the couple with their three dogs, writing, “Kids are a struggle y’all. But Merry Christmas from our little dysfunctional family to yours!!!”</p><p>Winter's outfit today,&nbsp;however, is a little different (and probably a little less comfortable) with some tall high heels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November, <a href=#>Winter and Meaden</a> celebrated their first year together. “Happy 1 year anniversary my love. I’m the luckiest girl in the entire world,” she wrote on Instagram at the time. “Thank you for being the incredible man you are, and for making me the happiest I could’ve ever imagined. Here’s to many, many more. I love you.”</p><p>Meaden responded with his own post, writing, “I can’t believe it’s been a year. We’ve had adventures. Gotten dolled up countless times. And travelled through 3 continents together. I never imagined I’d be this happy,” the actor wrote. “I love you more than anything! Happy anniversary Peanut Butter!!!!”</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>ARIEL WINTER SHOWS OFF ANOTHER GLUTE WORKOUT</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yivsieo2avmaPBpr6MoaCgoF2dsqa40mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
