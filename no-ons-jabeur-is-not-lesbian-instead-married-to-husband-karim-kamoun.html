Her husband is a former fencer and he also works as her fitness coach since mid-2017.</p><p>The adorable pair exchanged their wedding vows on October 29, 2015, and have been together ever since.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Ons Jabeur’s husband, Karim is also a big-time fitness lover and he holds a master’s degree in sports science. He is a strength and conditioning coach as well.</p><p>According to GQ Middle East, Kamoun devotes a large portion of his profession as a fitness trainer to his wife.</p><p>The change from wife and husband to trainee and trainer wasn’t simple, either. In 2020, Jabeur told the media, “He realizes that it was difficult in the beginning.</p><p>Because we’re not familiar with working together, when he asked me to go run, it felt a little bit like an order, and at first, I didn’t like it. And if he threw the medicine ball incorrectly or something, I would cause a scandal over a pretty minor issue.”</p><p>However, as per the tennis star, the pair got used to it eventually. After having several fights and talks, they got good results. Besides, the power couple don’t share any kids yet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May Also Be Interested In: </strong>Thanasi Kokkinakis Illness and Health 2023: Australian Tennis Player Battled With Depression</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKafYryvv4yjmJudpad6qr%2BMp6atZZyawKO1wKdkoqajqbKisIymmKuqmZqxbsDOZp%2Buq5KWu6V5ypqpoqVdoK6uu9SnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
