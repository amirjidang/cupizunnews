The first image shows the jeweller and athlete posing together at a restaurant. Dressed in an all-white outfit, Tatum can be seen wearing the white watch on his left wrist.</p><p>A second photo in the slideshow gives an up-close look at the watch. With a completely transparent face, all of the watch’s mechanical insides are in view. The pieces features silver and black hardware, with the Richard Mille name visible in small, white lettering on the top of the watch’s face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Happy birthday to my guy @jaytatum0,” Da Jeweler wrote in the caption, revealing he delivered the custom piece to the basketball player himself in Boston.</p><p>“Had to make a special delivery in Boston with that all white Richard Mille RM055 Bubba Watson! Half a million well spent #Investment #JaysonTatum #AllWhiteEverything,” the jeweller continued alongside a money bag emoji.</p><p>Richard Mille is a Swiss luxury watch company, and their pieces certainly don’t come cheap. According to <a href=#>Wrist Advisor</a>, Richard Mille watches can range anywhere from $60,000 to $1.3 million. Factors like the material, complications, and whether it’s limited edition all affect the price of the designer brand’s watches.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Half a million dollars may seem like a huge chunk of change to spend on a watch, but perhaps not for someone who signed a contract worth almost $200 million recently.</p><p>In November 2020, Tatum <a href=#>agreed to a five-year contract extension</a> with <a href=#>the Boston Celtics</a> valued at $195 million. But it’s suspected the deal could increase to $200 million in coming years. TMZ notes that Tatum has already made $57 million since joining the Celtics in 2017.</p><p>Even though Tatum is now wearing half a million dollars on his wrist, that may not have been his best birthday gift this year. On Thursday, the athlete shared a sweet video of his 4-year-old son taking him to his favourite spots in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tatum later uploaded images from a birthday celebration, with the first photo showing the basketball star embracing his toddler. The background is decorated with a variety of balloons, including orange and black ones designed to look like basketballs. It’s clear that Tatum had a good time celebrating his 24th!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher & Mila Kunis To Match Up To $3 Million In Donations For Ukraine</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Instagram @ericdajeweler</a>, <a href=#>Wrist Advisor</a>, <a href=#>SI</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Goqq2nnmKwprjTopqsZZqWxrS7zWarmqylonqztcKhmKucXaK2rbjEZq6arJOdeqO10a2fnZmpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
