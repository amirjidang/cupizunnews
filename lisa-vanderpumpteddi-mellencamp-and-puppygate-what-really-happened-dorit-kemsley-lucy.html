The saga of the dog named Lucy Lucy Apple Juice dominated Season 9 of the Bravo show seems to still be ongoing, despite taking place years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dorit Kemsley and her husband, PK, adopted a dog from Lisa Vanderpump’s rescue organization, Vanderpump Dogs. Fashion designer Dorit claimed that Lucy nipped PK and their children, so she “rehomed” the rescue dog. The whole season was centered around the feud between Dorit, Lisa Vanderpump and Teddi Mellencamp, all about the little rescue dog. Of course, all the other housewives became involved and took sides in the arguement.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But now Page Six is reporting</a> that Mellencamp and<strong> </strong>Vanderpump have settled the matter, years after it happened. So what really happened and why has it taken so long to resolve?</p><h2 id=who-was-involved-in-real-housewives-puppygate><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Who Was Involved In Real Housewives' PuppyGate?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like any good Real Housewives feud, everyone seemed to get involved. It started between Lisa Vanderpump and Dorit Kemsley. But soon Teddi Mellencamp got involved, and then Kyle Richards followed by two of Vanderpump’s employees at Vanderpump Dogs: executive director John Sessa and event manager John Blizzard.</p><h2 id=what-happened-with-lucy-lucy-apple-juice><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>What Happened With Lucy Lucy Apple Juice?</span></h2><p>In the RHOBH‘s season 9 premiere, the audience learned that before the cameras started rolling, Dorit Kemsley adopted Lucy from Lisa Vanderpump’s dog rescue foundation.</p><p>Though Dorit called Lucy “a beautiful, adorable puppy,” Lucy “was not the right fit” for her family after she bit her husband PK and their two kids — son Jagger, and daughter Phoenix, “a few times.” So, Kemsley explained that she found a “beautiful home” for Lucy and gave the dog away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-did-rhobh-s-lucy-lucy-apple-juice-really-end-up><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Where Did RHOBH's Lucy Lucy Apple Juice Really End Up?</span></h2><p>The problem is, Lucy’s new owner also didn’t want the dog and gave Lucy to a shelter. That shelter then scanned Lucy’s microchip, which tracked it back to Vanderpump Dogs.</p><p>This is where all the problems started, something Dorit Kemsley claims is totally unintentional.</p><p>"It’s not good for us for a shelter to be calling us saying, ‘We’ve got a Vanderpump dog down here, ” Lisa Vanderpump said on the show, adding that the pet adoption contract Kemsley signed carries fines for situations like this. “We make very, very stringent rules and regulations so that that mistake can’t be made. That’s why we put in the $1,000 penalty so that it can’t be made.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=another-dog-also-attacked-dorit-kemsley-s-children><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Another Dog Also Attacked Dorit Kemsley's Children</span></h2><p>Dorit Kemsley did own another dog before Lucy named Maddie. The dog was also rescued from Vanderpump Dogs, where she was also returned. This pet also bit Kemsley’s daughter Phoenix “on the face.” Lucy was adopted after Maddie was returned.</p><h2 id=lisa-vanderpump-was-disappointment-with-dorit-kemsley><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Lisa Vanderpump Was Disappointment With Dorit Kemsley</span></h2><p>Lisa Vanderpump discussed her disappointment at the situation with Dorit Kemsley, saying that she wished she would have given the dog back to Vanderpump Dogs instead of to another family. “I know that you had no bad intention,” Vanderpump told Kemsley in the opening episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Maybe in [Dorit’s] mind, she believed it was going to a good home,” Vanderpump says on camera. “There is no way she would have given the dog away to be dropped off at a shelter. I stand by that.”</p><p>In fact, Vanderpump was so sure that Kemsley was innocent that she did her best to shut down any conversations about PuppyGate. At no point was she angry, she was more disappointed that Lucy wasn't returned to her shelter.</p><h2 id=teddi-mellencamp-rehashes-puppygate-drama><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Teddi Mellencamp Rehashes PuppyGate Drama</span></h2><p>When all things seem to resolve themselves, Teddi Mellencamp decided to bring things up again. After a visit to Vanderpump Dogs, employee John Sessa brought Lucy out. “You don’t recognize her?” he asked Denise Richards. “It’s Dorit’s dog. She’s with us again.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I 1,000 percent don’t want to talk about this. It’s handled. … It’s not her fault,” Vanderpump said, trying to shut it down.</p><p>“It was not handled properly,” Sessa said. “I’m p*ss*d and everyone here’s pissed. And I’ve been dealing with this now for a week.”</p><p>It turns out Teddi is good friends with John Blizzard, the Vanderpump Dogs Events Coordinator, and had heard about what had happened before. “They told me because they’re really upset about it,” Mellencamp told Richards during her trip to Vanderpump Dogs. “But they were like, ‘Don’t say anything’ and I was like, ‘I won’t.’ And I keep my word.”</p><h2 id=dorit-kemsley-knew-teddi-mellencamp-was-aware-of-the-dog-situation><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Dorit Kemsley Knew Teddi Mellencamp Was Aware Of The Dog Situation</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dorit Kemsley didn’t know about Denise Richards, but she was definitely aware that Teddi Mellencamp already knew about all the puppy drama.</p><p>While at dinner together in episode 1, Lisa Vanderpump told Dorit, “John Blizzard spoke to Teddi.” Vanderpump also admitted in episode 3 that she had texted Kemsley, “Teddi knows,” in an effort to “clear this up and get in front of it.”</p><p>“Of course I told Dorit because Teddi and Dorit’s history has been a little tenuous,” Vanderpump revealed. “If I hadn’t told Dorit and Teddi brought it up, then I probably would have been to blame for that as well.” Kemsley never discussed it with Mellencamp until episode 3, when she brought it up at dinner and exposed the fact that Denise Richards knew it, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-lisa-rinna-got-involved-with-puppygate><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Lisa Rinna Got Involved With PuppyGate</span></h2><p>Of course, Lisa Rinna got involved too.</p><p>In episode 3, Lisa Rinna walked in on a conversation between Lisa Vanderpump and Denise Richards in which Richards joked about Kemsley being “allergic” to dogs. She was hinting about what had gone on with Lucy, but Vanderpump didn’t want to discuss it at all and immediately went quiet— something that made Rinna suspicious.</p><p>“I refuse to talk about it now,” Vanderpump said. “I don’t want to talk about this. There are no winners. If anybody’s going to bring it up, it’s just because they’re going to stir up sh*t.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Hereâs Why People Think That Lisa Vanderpump Hated Being On âRHOBHâ">Here’s Why People Think That Lisa Vanderpump Hated Being On ‘RHOBH’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rinna had already been criticized by Vanderpump in previous seasons for not being involved in the group, but this drama interested her. The next day Rinna asked Richards and Mellencamp about what was going on. She was told by the pair about how Vanderpump’s employees brought Kemsley’s dog around while the cameras were up. Rinna believed Lisa was setting Dorit up.</p><p>“All Lisa Vanderpump wants to do is punish Dorit about the dog,” Rinna said. “She can’t do it, so she had those boys do it. She doesn’t want to get her hands dirty.”</p><h2 id=was-lisa-vanderpump-guilty><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Was Lisa Vanderpump Guilty?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other housewives united against Lisa Vanderpump, who has maintained her innocence throughout — reiterating multiple times that she tried to shut down the conversation. Dorit and Denise chose to side with Teddi over Lisa, which cause a season look argument.</p><p>“I tried to protect Dorit. If Dorit had just handled it properly, there wouldn’t be this scenario,” Vanderpump said in episode 3. “I’m not a liar. These women questioning my integrity? I don’t appreciate it at all. They don’t even know what the f— they are talking about.” Vandercamp ultimately took no responsibility for the issue and instead blamed Teddi for gossiping.</p><h2 id=teddi-mellencamp-feels-set-up-in-puppygate><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Teddi Mellencamp Feels Set Up In PuppyGate</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teddi Mellencamp believes she was set up on the show by Lisa Vanderpump. In fact, Mellencamp went even further by claiming that Vanderpump told Sessa and Blizzard to bring up PuppyGate on camera that day at Vanderpump Dogs. “The staff at Vanderpump Dogs told me damaging information about Dorit, yet I did not tell anyone,” Mellencamp said in the fourth episode. “I know 100 percent they were told to tell me [by] Lisa.”</p><p>Vandercamp of course denied these allegations. “Why would I tell [Sessa] to say it? … I wanted to shut it down, and I absolutely stand by that.”</p><p>She explained, “I couldn’t say possibly to Dorit that Teddi instigated the conversation when John brought the dog out because we were all there, and we saw that Teddi didn’t instigate the situation. That was John [Sessa] and John was out of order.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-teddi-mellencamp-in-on-puppygate><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Was Teddi Mellencamp In On PuppyGate?</span></h2><p>Teddi held some stuff back about PuppyGate. It wasn’t until episode 4 — when Lisa Vanderpump’s husband Ken printed out text messages between Teddi Mellencamp and John Blizzard — did we learn that Mellencamp had actually known about Dorit's dog situation before she arrived at Vanderpump Dogs for filming.</p><p>“Have the dog there, and I can say it looks like Dorit’s dog,” Mellencamp texted John Blizzard. “Either way it will come out.”</p><p>“We can lay it all out about everything,” Blizzard texted back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Teddi Mellencamp Blames Ex RHOBH Dana Wilkey For Dorit's Home Invasion">Teddi Mellencamp Blames Ex RHOBH Dana Wilkey For Dorit's Home Invasion</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mellencamp admitted that she initially conspired with Blizzard. “I was kind of in it. Texting with them, being catty back,” Mellencamp told Erika Girardi, a confidante throughout the seasons, “They wanted me to say it. I already know this going into Vanderpump Dogs and I couldn’t go through … with telling everybody what Dorit did.”</p><p>“When I really knew the setup was beyond was when I saw Lisa and how she was acting. ‘No, no, don’t you dare,’ ” Mellencamp revealed in episode 6. “This bad acting and at this moment, I shifted. I was like, ‘I don’t care about this petty crap. This is someone I can’t look at anymore. You just set me up. And now you’re pretending that your hands are clean so that you can be relevant and you can be the hero to Dorit?

He said he refused her request to gather the cast. She left midway through that season's filming.</p><h2 id=where-is-lucy-lucy-apple-juice-now><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Where Is Lucy Lucy Apple Juice Now?</span></h2><p>Luckily, the dog at the center of all this has found a happy new home elsewhere. Now called Lulu, the dog lives with model Theis, whose roommate and friend worked at Vanderpump Dogs. “I knew from the second I saw her that we were going to adopt her, but we fostered her for about a month,” she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When we first got her, she was extremely terrified of everything,” Theis explained, adding that the puppy appeared to be frightened of any unfamiliar object placed near her. “I don’t know what happened behind closed doors, or at the house where she was at before I got her, but all I know is that when I got her she was terrified.”</p><p>Since Lulu was born at Vanderpump Dogs, staff at the foundation knew her behavior well and told the puppies new owner that Lulu returned to the foundation “a completely different dog.”</p><p>“You have to train your puppy that biting is not okay, and that’s what we did,” Theis told People. “Anytime she would play bite, we would so ‘No bite!’ and now she doesn’t bite.” The dog is living a happy life and is even an Instagram star!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-puppygate-resolved><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is PuppyGate Resolved?</span></h2><p>Teddi Mellencamp finally dished about the resolution of their feud on an episode of her podcast, Two T’s In A Pod. The former housewife revealed that the Lisa Vanderpump and Teddi Mellencamp ran into each other at an afterparty for the MTV Movie & TV Awards.</p><p>“We did have a nice conversation. We were respectful to one another.” Mellencamp added, “I haven’t talked to [Lisa] in years. The last time that we had any conversation was not good.” Teddi explained that when she walked in, she asked Lisa's husband Ken Todd if he thought she should “try and clear the air,” and he agreed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Ultimately, we just went through it. It was mainly, like, all the things we probably would have said to each other at the reunion, had we had the reunion,” Vanderpump famously missed the season 9 reunion and never appeared on the show again. Teddi went on to say that after their 40-minute conversation, they are “healed-ish.” She still doesn’t think the pair will be hanging out together anytime soon, though.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Teddi Mellencamp's Life Has Been Very Different Since Being Fired From âRHOBHâ, Here's Why">Teddi Mellencamp's Life Has Been Very Different Since Being Fired From ‘RHOBH’, Here's Why</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYsOiusOeqamtnaXBprDDomSmnZyhsq%2BvwKanZpmemXqxwc%2BpsKCZpJp6uLTArWSrnZGhubp5x5qnqZ2emrFusM6roK1lm5q6tLjEsmSlrZOufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
