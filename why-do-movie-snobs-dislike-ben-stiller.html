But fans of Ben Stiller have noticed a troubling trend when it comes to discussing the films he's been in. They suggest that movie snobs dislike Ben Stiller, and they think they've figured out why.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film snobs --&nbsp;AKA normal people who love movies and obsess over movies in online forums and on blogs -- mostly populate Reddit threads and sometimes Rotten Tomatoes reviews. And there's an interesting trend that fans have uncovered.</p><h2 id=movie-snobs-dislike-ben-stiller-s-comedy>Movie Snobs Dislike Ben Stiller's Comedy</h2><p>Ben Stiller has a very long resume in Hollywood, and he's best known for his comedic chops. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his "evil cameo" in 'Hubie Halloween'</a> was the result of a long-running gag and it definitely had fans chuckling.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's Why Ben Stiller And His Wife Almost Divorced" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Ben Stiller And His Wife Almost Divorced</a></span></p><p>But many self-proclaimed film buffs don't like Ben's characters or his movies. They downright bash most of his projects and say they're "bad movies." Fans discussed the phenomenon on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, explaining that the folks over in the designated r/movies subreddit have no love for Stiller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And it's&nbsp;weird, say fans, because who doesn't like to laugh? Eventually, though, they came to the realization that people who dislike Ben Stiller's movies are upset about something specific.</p><h2 id=non-fans-don-t-appreciate-the-value-ben-stiller-adds-to-film>Non-Fans Don't Appreciate The Value Ben Stiller Adds To Film</h2><p>Some commenters think that most of Ben Stiller's work has been on&nbsp;"really bad movies," but that they don't really care. Those particular non-fans say that they can still enjoy a movie that's not necessarily "good" -- which led to a more in-depth discussion on what constitutes a good movie.</p><p>Because how can a moviegoer&nbsp;enjoy a movie that's inherently&nbsp;bad?</p><p>All this to say that while even self-proclaimed fans of Stiller can't agree on whether his films are good or not, they've agreed that the real haters don't like one aspect of the actor's comedy: he's just out there for a good time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In contrast with "serious" actors in more high-brow films, Ben "isn't claiming to be an auteur or anything. He's just trying to entertain," said one viewer.</p><p>That's the exact reason why fans speculate that Ben Stiller doesn't have more fans: he's out for a good time and not an Oscar. For example, fans&nbsp;did like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his reading-Trump-tweets-as-Zoolander bit</a>, but that didn't earn him any awards.</p><h2 id=even-fans-say-ben-stiller-lacks-passion>Even Fans Say Ben Stiller Lacks Passion</h2><p>One "huge Ben Stiller fan" admitted that "I think people on r/movies don't like him because he is in a lot of bankable family type movies, without much passion." Even fans can admit that Ben's career seems to have grown out of a desire to make people laugh, not necessarily connect with them on a deeper level.</p><p>The entire fan theory makes sense, especially if 'movie snobs' are looking for a high-budget, well-executed film with a smart and snappy storyline -- and no punch lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Who Has The Higher Net Worth: Ben Stiller Or Owen Wilson?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Has The Higher Net Worth: Ben Stiller Or Owen Wilson?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbxuuc6voJ5lo6O8o7%2BMnaCspJmgsm6uxKdkrKyZobmmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
