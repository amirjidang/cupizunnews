She vowed never to post clips of herself because those who did were reportedly looked down upon.</p><p>But it didn’t take long before Dixie found out that her younger sister has been using the same app to post her own videos. At first, she questioned what Charli was doing, but it didn’t take long before everything blew up for their family.</p><p>In fact, the D’Amelios were named as the first TikTok family because their parents, Marc and Heidi are also active users of the app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I remember Dixie was so embarrassed to have a sister on TikTok. And then in May 2019 – oh! I guess that was a year ago – all my friends started making TikToks. They asked me for help copying some of the dances. They said, ‘Oh, you’ve got to teach us.’ And I said, ‘I don’t want to, it’s weird, I don’t even have my own account.’ But then I started making videos and I guess I started having a lot of fun?” Charli told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>.</p><p>Dixie cut her sister off to ask if she remembers how some people would stop her on the street and ask where they remember her from. And Charli would say social media because she was embarrassed to say that she’s on TikTok.</p><p>Three years after joining TikTok, Dixie and Charli are earning millions not only from the platform and their other social media accounts. They now have brand deals and endorsements.</p><h2 id=dixie-s-net-worth>Dixie’s Net Worth</h2><p>According to <a href=#>Forbes</a>, Dixie’s net worth is estimated at $2.9 million. And that’s not bad for someone who didn’t want to be seen on TikTok!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She currently has over 30 million followers on TikTok. And she has also signed deals with Hollister and Morphe together with her younger sister.</p><p>Dixie, who also happens to be a talented singer, just dropped her single “Be Happy.” The track has garnered approximately 58 million streams shortly after its launch. And the video also became the no. 1 trending clip on YouTube.</p><h2 id=charli-s-net-worth>Charli’s Net Worth</h2><p>Charli’s net worth is estimated at $4 million. Shortly after she became trending on TikTok, singer Bebe Rexha invited her to join her in the opening for the Jonas Brothers in Brooklyn.</p><p>The 17-year-old then moved from her hometown of Connecticut to Los Angeles with her sister. And she has appeared on the Tonight Show Starring With Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>At one point, Charli was also invited to attend the Paris Fashion Week for Prada. And she documented her journey on TikTok.</p><p>As of late, she has already struck deals with EOS cosmetics, Hollister, and <a href=#>Hype House</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charli also appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Sabra hummus. And she has also launched her own Charli-branded merchandise. The social media star has also <a href=#>partnered with Dunkin Donuts</a>.</p><p>In March, Dunkin Donuts released a statement announcing their partnership with Charli.</p><p>“Our fans can’t get enough of the genuine love between Charli and Dunkin’, so creating the Charli x Dunkin’ merch collection felt like the perfect next step in our relationship. This collection is our way of sprinkling more Charli and Dunkin’ love onto our fans. We worked hand in hand with Charli to bring her signature look into each accessory so our fans can sip their Charli Cold Foam in style this spring,” Kemma Kefalas, brand engagement manager at Dunkin, said.</p><h2 id=the-price-they-must-pay>The price they must pay</h2><p>However, Dixie and Charli’s successful careers don’t come without a downside. The sisters were previously <a href=#>accused of disrespecting their family’s chef</a>.</p><p>On her YouTube channel, chef Aaron May served the D’Amelio family with his famous paella, and Dixie found a snail in her food. The chef explained that the snail is there as an omen of good luck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But despite the chef’s explanation, Dixie was caught on camera gagging. And this gesture didn’t sit well with her mom and her critics.</p><p>Her sister, on the other hand, asked the chef for dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets even though there’s a widespread of dishes on their table.</p><p>Following the incident, Charli lost more than 1 million followers on TikTok. She issued a public apology afterward.</p><p>It seems Dixie and Charli have already recovered from the incident because it’s business as usual for the sisters. And no, there’s no rivalry between them.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Top 5 Richest TikTokers In The World</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, <a href=#>Dunkin Donuts</a>, <a href=#>Today</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxqsTInmScoJGnuap5w5qknqSZpHqku8ypmKudXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
