The late actor’s friend Athenna Crosby recently opened up about what Matthew was like the day before his death, as she was one of the last people to see him alive.</p><p>“He was talking the whole time and was super excited to be hanging out,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Athenna, 25, told Us Weekly of the last time she saw Matt</a>. “It was great.

In fact, their lunch at Hotel Bel-Air the day before his passing was their second time meeting in person.</p><p>“He was very healthy and talking about how he was looking forward to hitting the pickleball court and how he had gotten very into it,” she continued. “He was telling me I needed to try it and it was fun. He said he was losing weight and getting in shape.”</p><p>Athenna added, “He was in a positive place and doing so good [and] was being extra healthy.”</p><p>Matthew reportedly completed a two hour Pickleball game before he was found <a href=#>unresponsive in a jacuzzi at his Los Angeles home by his assistant</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While authorities have ruled out foul play, a toxicology report has been ordered to determine if substances played a part in his death.

Matthew had been open about his past struggles with addiction. Athenna claims that the Friends alum was open about his past with her during their meet-up, but seemed to be in a better place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:01</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Friends-cast.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The 'Friends' Cast Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>As we reminisce about the hilarious antics and heartwarming moments shared by the Friends cast, it's time to delve into their net worths.</span><p>“He said for a lot of years he was lost in the addiction and how he fully came out on the other side,” she went on. “He was clean and didn’t order a drink. In fact, he didn’t even want a drink menu. He was taking all the temptation out of his life.”</p><p>“I was shocked. I had to hear it from the news first. I thought it was so devastating,” she continued, recalling how she discovered Matthew had passed. “At the time, I had to pull [my car] over and read it and ask myself if it was true. It’s so disturbing because I had just spoken to him hours before he passed.”</p><p>Matthew was 54 years old at the time of his death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2Beqauxo2Kzs7XEp5tmqpWrsqK40mauoZmkYsSiv4yloKSdXZmuunnBnp2oqpVisaat06Fm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
