I don’t know where I am. Let me turn the camera around actually. What do you think?” Eric asks while showing Anna his location.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Watch-Grace-Van-Dien-Call-Out-Older-BF-s-Inappropriate-and-Aggressive-Visit-in-What-Comes-Around-featured.png><p>In response, Anna hangs up and <a href=#>questions Eric’s actions over text</a>, writing, “Do you realize how inappropriate and aggressive this is?”</p><p>Eric calls back to issue an apology. “I am sorry. I guess I thought it was some big gesture. A big dumb gesture,” he says. “I have a gift for you, I will leave it on the porch.”</p><p>What Comes Around explores Anna’s relationship with mother Beth (<strong>Summer Phoenix</strong>) after she starts dating Eric. <a href=#>The coming-of-age film addresses topics</a> such as toxic online culture, complicated family dynamics and grooming.</p><p>Van Dien, 26, recently opened up about how she collaborated with Gallner, 36, on Anna and Eric’s <a href=#>complicated fictional romance.</a></p><p>“Kyle is an angel. I am constantly looking for the next thing he is in. Like, I tried to watch Smile recently because I saw he is in that, but I got like five minutes in and then I got too scared,” she joked to Us. “But Kyle is the kindest person. He is always making sure that everything is OK and our communication is on par. I don’t understand how we found everyone [in the cast].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Watch-Grace-Van-Dien-Call-Out-Older-BF-s-Inappropriate-and-Aggressive-Visit-in-What-Comes-Around.png><p>Director Amy Redford also praised Gallner’s commitment to the project, saying, “He’s really dedicated to the work and I think what everybody shared was the desire to bring as much compassion to their characters as they possibly could. In doing so, you do a deep dive. You start doing your own internal research [and] you carry things in your pocket that nobody sees.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Redford, 52, continued: “So he’s just that actor and his awareness about the people around him is what makes him such a great listener on screen — which is hugely captivating. He and Grace both shared that. Many times, I just have to get out of the way. But it was [also about] seeing him bring things to the table that I don’t think he’d necessarily be allowed to bring before — which is for a director the most exciting thing that can happen.”</p><p>What Comes Around opens in select theaters and is available on VOD Friday, August 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6rmZOaeretzWabop2eYra0ecCmma6rmJqxbq7YZqalnJWneqO72J%2Bpop2emXqquoywn5qsXZi8rrHSZpirp6WjsXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
