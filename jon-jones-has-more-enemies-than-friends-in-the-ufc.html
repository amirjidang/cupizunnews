He's one of the best champions that the world's largest fight promotion has on its roster and he holds many UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, longest win streak, and most submission victories. He is also the youngest person in UFC history to become a world champion, claiming the Light Heavyweight crown at 24 years of age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his comparatively young age, Jones has been in the UFC for a long time and you can't be in the UFC for as long as Jones has without making a few enemies within the roster. Jones has also managed to make some friends with some of the other fighters in the UFC, despite some of his more controversial moments.</p><p>So let's go over UFC fighters that hate Jon Jones and those that like him.</p><h2 id=hate---dominick-reyes><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Hate - Dominick Reyes</span></h2><p>Dominick Reyes gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Jones</a> the closest fight of Jones' career since Jones vs Gustaffson I. There is a large portion of MMA fans and analysts that believe that Reyes won that fight and in the days after the match, Reyes posted on social media stating that Jon Jones knows he lost that match.</p><h2 id=love---michelle-waterson><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Love - Michelle Waterson</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Waterson</a> and Jon Jones are training partners at the MMA super camp Jackson-Wink Gym in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

After Jon Jones' most recent arrest Michelle posted on social media that she will always be by his side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Female UFC Fighters That Everybody Has A Crush On</a></span></p><h2 id=hate---thiago-santos><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Hate - Thiago Santos</span></h2><p>Thiago Santos is another one of Jon Jones' recent opponents that gave the once thought undetectable champ a pretty hard time. In a familiar case to Dominick Reyes, there were plenty of fans who thought that Santos won this fight and one judge even gave the fight to Santos.</p><h2 id=love---anderson-silva><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Love - Anderson Silva</span></h2><p>There is a ton of respect between these two greats. These two are both top contenders for the title of the greatest fighter of all time and both these champions respect each other's achievements. There's even a video floating around of these two having a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joke sparring session on the streets</a>.</p><h2 id=hate---rampage-jackson><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Hate - Rampage Jackson</span></h2><p>Similar to his other matches, the lead up to the match-up between Jon Jones and Quinton "Rampage" Jackson was full of venom. There was trash talk from each fighter and the face-off was intense. In their fight, Jones became the first person to ever finish Jackson, doing so via Rear Naked Choke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love---georges-saint-pierre><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Love - Georges Saint Pierre</span></h2><p>Another UFC great that Jon Jones has a ton of respect for.

The two even met each other outside a club and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">avoid the paparazzi </a>together.</p><h2 id=hate---brock-lesnar><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Hate - Brock Lesnar</span></h2><p>This is a bit of a weird one because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brock Lesnar</a> is done with fighting in an octagon. After Jon Jones became the first man to ever knock to ever finish Daniel Cormier with a vicious combo of a head kick and ground and pound. During his post-fight speech, Jones called out Lesnar saying he was going to beat him despite weighing 30 pounds less than him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Reasons Why WWE Should Move On From Brock Lesnar (And 8 Why They Won’t)</a></span></p><h2 id=love---ronda-rousey><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Love - Ronda Rousey</span></h2><p>Ronda and Jones are pretty solid friends at t's very easy to see whenever they interact.

The trash talk between him and Jones was great and seemingly did effect, Jones. Jones later said that Sonnen's trash talk made no sense.</p><h2 id=love---anthony-johnson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Love - Anthony Johnson</span></h2><p>Anthony Johnson and Jon Jones is a matchup that came so close to happening but unfortunately, the MMA gods thought we didn't deserve to see it. Despite the disappointment, they had some fun moments, like when they pranked Dana White by making it look like they were going to fight at a press conference.</p><h2 id=hate---luke-rockhold><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hate - Luke Rockhold</span></h2><p>After losing the Middleweight title Luke Rockhold started talking about how he wanted to move up to Light Heavyweight and challenge Jon Jones for that division's title. Rockhold's first match in the division was against Jan Blachowicz who he was looking past. too bad for Rockhold Blachowicz knocked him out cold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love---yair-rodriguez><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Love - Yair Rodriguez</span></h2><p>Yair Rodriguez once spent some time training down Albuquerque, New Mexico when he first decided to start training in locations within the United States.

The pair have become champions together and have had a long and documented friendship. You can frequently see them in each other's fight vlogs leading up to matches and Jones even calls Holm an older sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hate---daniel-cormier><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Hate - Daniel Cormier</span></h2><p>Daniel Cormier and Jon Jones probably have the most heated rivalry in the history of MMA and that's saying something. Jones and Cormier's beef go back to their first match where Jones said he was going to kill Cormier. Add in a few canceled matches and some more back and forth and it's easy to see why they don't like each other.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8 Rumored Fights Dana White Needs To Book ASAP (And 7 He Must Scrap)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKZdn7yvsdJmn5qrXaK8s7GMnqWepZmawG7Ax5qlZp6inrKvsNJmoKdlpJ2ybsHFnGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
