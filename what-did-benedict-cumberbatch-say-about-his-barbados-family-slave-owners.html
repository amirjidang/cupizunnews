Over the years, Barbados has been pursuing reparations from the colonial powers responsible for subjecting its people to the atrocities of slavery for nearly four centuries. However, the focus has now shifted to affluent descendants of individual slave owners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among those who might be implicated is the family of Benedict Cumberbatch. The Oscar-nominated actor has enjoyed remarkable success in his career portraying Sherlock Holmes and <a href=#>MCU's</a> Doctor Strange. However, his family's history carries a more horrific legacy. The actor's ancestor, Abraham Cumberbatch, obtained an extensive sugar plantation in Barbados in 1728. It is believed that over a century, more than 250 individuals were coerced into labor on the estate, contributing to the Cumberbatch family's wealth and prominence in Britain during that era.</p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch-39-s-ancestors-were-involved-in-human-workforce-exploitation>Benedict Cumberbatch's Ancestors Were Involved In Human Workforce Exploitation</h2><p>According to a 2014 report by the Daily Mail, during the 1700s, Benedict Cumberbatch's seventh-great-grandfather, Abraham Cumberbatch, acquired two sizable estates in Barbados. These properties were transformed into a sugar plantation known as the Cleland Plantation, which generated profits for the British monarchy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template.jpg><p>Historical records from the early 1800s indicate that the Cumberbatch family owned nearly 300 slaves on the plantation. Now, almost two centuries after the family relinquished ownership of the plantation, there is a possibility that their descendants may be obligated to provide restitution for the wrongs of the past.</p><p>As the British Empire began to abolish slavery in 1833, the government secured a loan of approximately $4.25 billion in present-day currency to compensate landowners for their loss. Regrettably, no compensation was provided to the enslaved families themselves, as it was instead granted to the owners for the perceived value of their property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Benedict Cumberbatch Really Turn Down A Role In The Upcoming Mandalorian Spin-Off?</a></span></p><p>Reportedly, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cumberbatch family accepted a payout in 1834, which, in today's value, would amount to approximately $6.38 million</a>. Benedict Cumberbatch has openly acknowledged his family's involvement in social injustices. In a 2018 interview with The Telegraph, he stated, "We have our past, you don't have to look far to see the slave-owning past. We were part of the whole sugar industry, which is a shocker."</p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch-did-not-try-to-hide-his-family-39-s-horrific-history>Benedict Cumberbatch Did Not Try To Hide His Family's Horrific History</h2><p>While both of Benedict Cumberbatch's parents, who are also actors, changed their last names to avoid inquiries about their heritage, the actor himself has never concealed his family's historical background. This is true even after <a href=#>he was abducted in Africa</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2007 statement with Scotsman, he shared his mother's concern about potential financial implications, saying, "When I became an actor, Mum wasn't keen on me keeping it.

Although the Cumberbatch family no longer possesses the property associated with their past, Benedict Cumberbatch has openly acknowledged his familial history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There are lots of Cumberbatches in our former Caribbean colonies. When their ancestors lost their African names, they called themselves after their masters. Reparation cases are ongoing in American courts. I've got friends involved in researching this scar on human history, and I've spoken to them about it. The issue of how far you should be willing to atone is interesting. I mean, it's not as if I'm making a profit from the suffering..." Cumberbatch stated as per BuzzFeed report.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-did-benedict-cumberbatch-say-about-his-family-in-barbados-and-their-horrific-history.jpg><p>While his ancestors were wealthy in the 18th century, Cumberbatch clarified that the family's wealth had significantly diminished by the time of his birth, and he grew up in a distinctly middle-class environment. <a href=#>The Doctor Strange star has led his private family life</a>, but early in his acting career, Cumberbatch gravitated towards roles in historical films that explored the legacy of slavery. He appeared in the 2007 film Amazing Grace, portraying former British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, who advocated for the abolition of slavery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, in 2013, he portrayed William Prince Ford, a Southern plantation owner in the critically acclaimed film 12 Years a Slave, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2014.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch And Martin Freeman: Which 'Sherlock' Star Has The Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Reflecting on his choice of roles, Cumberbatch admitted that he may have been motivated by a desire to address historical injustices.

If a ruling were to favor the island's case, it could establish a precedent, opening the door for Barbados to seek compensation from other descendants of landowners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template-2.jpg><p>David Denny, the General Secretary of the Caribbean Movement for Peace and Integration, expressed the view that any descendants of white plantation owners who benefited from human exploitation should be held accountable. "Any descendants of white plantation owners who have benefited from the slave trade should be asked to pay reparations, including the Cumberbatch family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, a member of the Caribbean Community's reparations commission clarified the commission's position and stated that they are not currently seeking reparations from the Cumberbatch family. David Comissiong, a Barbados politician, activist, and commission member, addressed the issue in an op-ed published in Barbados Today. He emphasized that neither the reparations commission nor Barbados had officially made any reparations claims against a European family.</p><p>Comissiong explained that the task force finds it more feasible to concentrate on legal entities like governments or companies rather than targeting a specific family. He also noted that he was misquoted in the Telegraph article.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch Secretly Had Two Roles In 'Doctor Strange'</a></span></p><p>While the Caribbean Reparations Commission (CRC) primarily directs its attention toward governments and companies, there has been a recent focus on a British politician named Richard Drax.
