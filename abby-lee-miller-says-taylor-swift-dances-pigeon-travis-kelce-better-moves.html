Let’s leave it at that. He’s a great dancer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abby was referring to Taylor’s current boyfriend, Travis Kelce, known for his career as an NFL player with the Chiefs. Given that Travis isn’t known for dancing at all, Abby’s comments were a clear diss towards Taylor.</p><p>Though Abby said she thinks it’s “too late” for Taylor to improve her dancing, she doesn’t believe the musician is concerned about it, given how successful her singing career has been with the dance moves she currently has.</p><p>“I don’t think she’s worried about it,” Abby went on. “I don’t think that’s her top priority right now. However, I think she does probably think that she should have danced as a kid. You know, they had her slumped over that guitar playing. And I loved her music then. That was the Taylor Swift that I fell in love with.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Abby didn’t comment on Taylor’s relationship with Travis any further in the podcast interview, she did reply to a TikTok video discussing her comments about the duo. Abby used it as an opportunity to further praise Travis’ dance skills.</p><p>Everyone can benefit from a class with me,” she commented. “I’ve seen clips of @Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, @Travis Kelce dancing it up both on the field and off. I think he’s a natural! Most football players like to show off! He’s a showman with swagger at heart!”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t065511-258.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Inside Look At Taylor Swift's Relationship With Her Parents</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the many health struggles her parents have faced, Andrea and Scott Swift always prioritized Taylor's dreams and passion for music.</span><h2 id=many-people-have-expressed-concern-over-taylor-and-travis>Many People Have Expressed Concern Over Taylor And Travis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-travis-kelce.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abby may be the latest celebrity to comment on Taylor and Travis’ high-profile relationship, but he’s certainly not the first. Apparently, even those close to Taylor have voice their concerns about the romance, which appears to be moving quickly. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor and Travis are even facing relentless engagement rumors</a>, despite only going public with their status in the summer.</p><p>Last month, a report claimed that <a href=#>Selena Gomez voiced concerns to Taylor over Travis’ intention</a>s, which came after his ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Maya Benberry issued a public warning to Taylor Swift</a> and exposed Travis for cheating.</p><p>While Selena didn’t respond to the reports, a similar one accused Gigi Hadid of having reservations about Travis. But the supermodel went on to deny the report, <a href=#>saying she was supportive of Taylor’s romance</a>. For now, Taylor hasn’t commented on any of the controversy over her current relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYm5qpYrmmsYymoKWklad6tK3YrGStmamhvLN50rCgn6xdma6vr8SsZKmhl5q8r3nTq5ivoaNiuKa4wp5km52kqbKzecyorZ6rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
